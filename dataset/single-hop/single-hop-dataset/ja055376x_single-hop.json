    {
      "question": "Why are Cd-17 and Cd-8 clusters only able to form singly bridged chains?",
      "answer": "Cd-17 and Cd-8 clusters can only form singly bridged chains because they use only two corners for cross-linking due to their -2 charge.",

    {
      "question": "How does the assembly of Cd-32 clusters differ in COV-1 and COV-2?",
      "answer": "In COV-1, Cd-32 clusters are joined through two TMDPy ligands into doubly bridged chains, while in COV-2, they are joined through one TMDPy molecule into singly bridged chains.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What causes the red-shift in optical absorption for the materials?",
      "answer": "The red-shift in optical absorption is caused by the use of larger clusters as building blocks, leading to longer wavelength absorption.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is COV-2 the only covalent superstructure containing separate cationic and anionic components?",
      "answer": "COV-2 contains separate cationic and anionic components because the replacement of only two -SPh corners by neutral ligands decreases the charge on each Cd-32 cluster from -4 to -2, requiring void space to accommodate charge-balancing cations.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },

      "question": "What is the role of adsorbent flexibility for adsorptive separation?",
      "answer": "The role of adsorbent flexibility for adsorptive separation is controversial, but the gating action, an unconventional type of flexibility, can be used to achieve molecular sieving.",

      "question": "What are the two isostructural metal-organic frameworks designed for in the study?",
      "answer": "The two isostructural metal-organic frameworks are designed for allowing CO2 adsorption from extremely low pressures and achieving molecular sieving by controlling the gating energy barrier.",

    {
      "question": "How does adding an amino group on the organic ligand affect the metal-organic framework?",
      "answer": "Adding an amino group on the organic ligand strengthens intra-framework hydrogen bonding, which increases the gating energy barrier to completely block N2 and CH4, giving record-high CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 selectivities.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the gating energy barrier in the context of molecular sieving?",
      "answer": "The gating energy barrier is significant because controlling it can achieve the ideal molecular sieving effect, selectively adsorbing smaller guests and completely excluding larger ones.",

    {
      "question": "What was the outcome of the quantitative mixture breakthrough experiments for CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 mixtures?",
      "answer": "The quantitative mixture breakthrough experiments showed molecular sieving of CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4, with CO2 being adsorbed much later than N2 and CH4, indicating high selectivity for CO2.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the host-guest interaction at the gating moment influence the adsorption of C2H4?",
      "answer": "The host-guest interaction at the gating moment is important for the diffusion and adsorption of C2H4, as strong adsorption of the guest molecule in the transiently opened aperture can lower the diffusion energy barrier.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What was demonstrated by the ability to inverse adsorption selectivity in the study?",
      "answer": "The ability to inverse adsorption selectivity by changing the separation condition demonstrates an exceptional example of controlling adsorbent flexibility and host-guest interaction for adsorptive separation.",

    {
      "question": "How does the self-organization of small molecules contribute to proton mobility?",
      "answer": "The self-organization of small molecules contributes to proton mobility by creating a nanophase separation between hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains, leading to a continuous acidic phase that facilitates proton transport.",

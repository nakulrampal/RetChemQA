    {
      "question": "Why were 4,5-diazafluorene groups selected for the synthesis of compound 4?",
      "answer": "Because they have good Bingel–Hirsch regioselectivity, high polarity for relatively easy purification, and exhibit exceptional affinity for metal ion coordination.",

    },
    {
      "question": "Why is controlling the regioselectivity of trans-1 additions to C60 challenging?",

    {
      "question": "What is the difference between the structures of 4a and 4b?",
      "answer": "4a forms a one-dimensional polymer chain, while 4b does not form a polymeric structure due to each silver ion being bound to two toluene molecules.",

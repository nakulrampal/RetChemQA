    {
      "question": "What experimental conditions are necessary for the successful conversion of 2D polymers into 3D MOFs with bridging ligands?",
      "answer": "The conversion requires the coherent cooperation of functional groups and the presence of sizable channels in the 2D polymer that allow bridging ligands to access and displace solvent molecules.",

      "question": "How does the structure of 1·Gd contribute to its catalytic activity in the cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxides?",
      "answer": "The structure of 1·Gd features eight-coordinated Gd3+ sites that serve as catalytic centers and [Gd60] nanocages that enrich CO2 around the window, accelerating the transformation of CO2.",

      "question": "Does the presence of NO3− ions within the nanocages of 1·Gd, 1·Tb, and 1·Dy contribute to their structure?",
      "answer": "No, the presence of NO3− ions within the nanocages of 1·Gd, 1·Tb, and 1·Dy does not contribute to their structure as indicated by XPS and IR analyses.",

      "question": "What is the role of Br− in the cycloaddition reaction of CO2 with epoxides catalyzed by 1·Gd?",

      "question": "True or False: The catalytic activity of 1·Gd in the cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxides is due to leached Gd3+ ions in the reaction solution.",

    {
      "question": "What is the effect of the window size in [Ln60] nanocages on the catalytic reaction of CO2 with epoxides?",
      "answer": "The window size in [Ln60] nanocages slightly bigger than the size of CO2 allows CO2 to enrich around the window, accelerating the reaction, but does not allow CO2 to enter the nanocage.",

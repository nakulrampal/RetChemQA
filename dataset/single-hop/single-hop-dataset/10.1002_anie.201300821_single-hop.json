    {
      "question": "Can the modified ligand 2-vinyl-1H-benzo[d]imidazole-5-carboxylic acid (H2Ln) be synthesized outside of the MOF framework?",
      "answer": "No, the synthesis of H2Ln appears to be possible only within the MOF framework due to the protection of the carboxylate group and the deprotonation of the imidazole through coordination.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the photoluminescence (PL) spectrum shift observed during the MOF's transformation?",
      "answer": "The PL spectrum shift signifies changes in the organic components of the framework, such as the transformation of the hydroxyethyl to the vinyl group, indicating an increase in conjugation.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the size of the MOF crystals affect the bromination reaction?",
      "answer": "The smaller the MOF crystals, the more brominated ligand was observed, indicating that bromination is more effective on the surface of smaller crystals.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of the brominated tag group in the modified MOF?",
      "answer": "The brominated tag group acts as a gate, preventing the inclusion of certain molecules and slowing down the inclusion and release of others.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the absorption behavior of the postsynthetically modified MOF compare to the as-synthesized MOF?",
      "answer": "The absorption behaviors of the postsynthetically modified MOF for different guest probes are different from those of the as-synthesized MOF, with modifications affecting the restoration and inclusion of molecules.",

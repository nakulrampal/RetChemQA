      "question": "What is the significance of the N···N distance in the formation of adducts with bidentate gallium Lewis acids?",
      "answer": "The N···N distance affects the type of adduct formed, with short distances leading to polymeric structures and distances matching the host Ga···Ga distance leading to cyclic 1:1 adducts.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of isonicotinic acid in the synthesis of CPM-31?",
      "answer": "Isonicotinic acid serves as an auxiliary ligand, with its pyridal ends anchored to the open metal sites of the In3O trimeric nodes, and its carboxyl ends stretching toward the centers of channels to capture metal ions.",

    {
      "question": "How does the pore size of CPM-32 compare to CPM-30?",
      "answer": "CPM-32 has smaller pore sizes compared to CPM-30 due to the insertion of secondary metal ions or clusters, which partition the large channel spaces into multiple smaller domains.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What is the primary difference between the BTC method and the extended hook method in MOF synthesis?",
      "answer": "The BTC method relies on the cooperative action of hooks from multiple ligands for metal capture, while the extended hook method uses auxiliary ligands anchored at open metal sites for metal capture, independent of the framework organic ligand.",

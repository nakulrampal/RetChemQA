      "question": "What method is used to purify the products of the synthesis?",

    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the negative charge being localized at the central carbon atom in the anions?",
      "answer": "The localization of the negative charge at the central carbon atom indicates that while the species are formally pseudo-halide ions, their reactivity differs from their lighter analogues due to a lack of significant negative charge buildup on the terminal atoms.",

      "question": "What is the primary challenge in synthesizing adducts of AsCCh@ anions via salt metathesis reactions?",
      "answer": "The challenge is that for all four of the heavier PnCCh@ ions, the greatest degree of negative charge accumulates on the central carbon atom, making them susceptible to attack at the carbon centre by electrophiles.",

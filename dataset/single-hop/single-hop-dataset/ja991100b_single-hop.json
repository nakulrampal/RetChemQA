      "question": "What causes the crystalline disorder in 5·AgOTf as mentioned in the article?",
      "answer": "The crystalline disorder in 5·AgOTf is probably caused by the molecule 5 itself having lower point group symmetry than the D3h symmetry of molecule 1, particularly due to the pentoxy group being covalently attached to only one of the three possible sites on the central benzene ring.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the article suggest the pseudohexagonal channels differ in their distortion from the ideal hexagonal cell?",
      "answer": "The distortion is an elongation of c/b for ThSi2 but a diminution for AlB2. However, as both this elongation and this diminution are roughly equal displacements from the ideal value, the pairs of reflections appear roughly equally spaced but in reversed order in the two different structural families.",

      "question": "What structural feature is common to all 20 compounds examined in the study?",

      "question": "What is the effect of the reaction between 6·AgOTf and trifluoroacetic anhydride in the solid state?",
      "answer": "The reaction between 6·AgOTf and trifluoroacetic anhydride in the solid state results in the near quantitative conversion of 6 into a single new compound, with little change in the overall crystal structure.",

      "question": "How does the study demonstrate the stability of the channel structure to chemical modifications?",
      "answer": "The study demonstrates the stability of the channel structure to chemical modifications by showing that it is stable to modification of the chemical functional groups, alteration of the size of the channel, removal of all guest molecules within the channel, and to a covalent bond forming reaction between guest and host.",

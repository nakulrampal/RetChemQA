      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the key elements used in the synthesis of heterometallic rare-earth MOFs?",
      "answer": "The key elements used in the synthesis are a high-energy donor (Eu), a low-energy acceptor (Yb), and an optically inactive ion (Gd).",
      "difficulty_level": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How is the luminescence decay dynamics manipulated in the study?",
      "answer": "The luminescence decay dynamics is manipulated via control over metal distribution in the heterometallic rare-earth MOFs.",
      "difficulty_level": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What method is used to demonstrate the utility of the materials as practical tags?",
      "answer": "The utility of the materials as practical tags is demonstrated via a dynamic double encoding method that uses the braille alphabet and by incorporation into photocurable inks patterned on glass.",
      "difficulty_level": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The study reveals that static, monochromatic luminescence is easy to duplicate using commonly available dyes.",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty_level": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What challenges do existing materials for secure encoding face according to the article?",
      "answer": "Existing materials suffer from challenges such as monochromatic and/or broad emission bands, complex synthesis methods, and the need for highly specialized interrogation equipment.",
      "difficulty_level": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of the TCPB linker in the MOFs?",
      "answer": "The TCPB linker directs nonanuclear cluster formation in the MOF, allows for cluster separation, and serves as an antenna molecule for both Eu and Yb, but not Gd.",
      "difficulty_level": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The study reports the synthesis of 13 compositions including single-, di-, and trimetallic compounds.",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty_level": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the presence of Gd affect the luminescence lifetime in trimetallic compounds?",
      "answer": "The presence of Gd increases the average distance between the emitting ions (Eu and Yb), reducing the statistical chance of energy transfer between them, thus affecting the luminescence lifetime.",
      "difficulty_level": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The heterometallic MOFs rely on compatible coordination geometries and crystallization kinetics of metals to avoid phase or domain separation.",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty_level": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    }

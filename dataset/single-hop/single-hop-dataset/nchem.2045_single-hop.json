    {
      "question": "What challenge is associated with obtaining precise structural information for metal-centered reactions in MOFs?",
      "answer": "The challenge is due to issues with high symmetry in certain MOFs, lower initial crystallinity for some chemically robust MOFs, and the reduction in crystallinity that can result from carrying out post-synthetic reactions on parent crystals.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What structural feature of the MOF discussed in the text predisposes it to binding a broad range of transition-metal ions?",
      "answer": "The structural feature is the flexibility of the chelating pyrazole donors, which predispose the material to binding a wide range of transition-metal ions.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the MOF's ability to undergo a flexible-to-rigid structural transformation?",
      "answer": "The significance is that it demonstrates the MOF's ability to accommodate geometric rearrangements associated with metal-centered chemical reactions, leading to preservation of crystallinity and enabling the study of inorganic reactivity within the MOF.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How was the Rh(III) species within the MOF confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction?",
      "answer": "The Rh(III) species was confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, which showed the Rh(I) complex had undergone oxidative addition of MeI and subsequent insertion reaction, leading to a Rh(III) species with a specific coordination geometry.",

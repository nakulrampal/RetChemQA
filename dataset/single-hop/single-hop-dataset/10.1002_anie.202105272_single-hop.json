      "answer": "The 2D-to-3D switch in breathing response is triggered by post-synthetic modification (PSM) that leads to a reduction in the amplitude of the breathing deformation in two dimensions associated with pore diameter, but a large increase in the third dimension associated with pore length.",

    {
      "question": "What does the activation-flip in SHF-62 involve?",
      "answer": "The activation-flip involves a rotation of about 150 degrees for half of the ligands to avoid steric clash between methyl groups, accompanied by a torsional rotation of the amide group.",

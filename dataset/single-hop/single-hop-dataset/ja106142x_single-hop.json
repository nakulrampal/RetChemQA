    {
      "question": "What structural change occurs in MIL-53 when loaded with ethylbenzene?",
      "answer": "When loaded with ethylbenzene, MIL-53 undergoes a distortion due to the out-of-plane rotation of the ethyl group, causing a dislocation of the hydroxyl group toward the pore center and a distortion of the octahedral environment of the Al ions.",

      "question": "What is the main reason for the improved stability of STAM-17-OEt compared to HKUST-1?",

      "question": "What is the effect of changing the 5-substituent on the isophthalate linker from ethoxy to methylcarboxy (-CO2Me) on the MOF's stability?",
      "answer": "The MOF behaves in the same way as STAM-17-OEt, showing that the electronic properties of the linker are not the major reason for improved stability.",

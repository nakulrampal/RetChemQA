      "question": "What is the significance of using B(C6F5)3 in the synthesis of weakly coordinating anions?",
      "answer": "B(C6F5)3 is used as a strong Lewis acid to form donor-acceptor adducts with strongly coordinating anions, leading to the formation of bulky, very weakly coordinating anions.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does the addition of B(C6F5)3 groups affect the volume of the anions discussed in the article?",
      "answer": "The addition of B(C6F5)3 groups significantly increases the volume of the anions, with each B(C6F5)3 group contributing approximately 430.5 Å3 to the ion volume.",

      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What potential applications are suggested for the weakly coordinating anions based on CN adducts?",
      "answer": "The weakly coordinating anions may serve as alternatives to other widely used weakly coordinating anions and could potentially increase catalytic activity when used as counterions for cationic early transition metal catalysts.",

      "answer": "The selectivity factor calculated using IAST does not fully represent the material's selectivity for O2 because it does not account for the strong chemisorption of O2 compared to the weak physisorption of N2, and it is hindered by the material's kinetic limitations at room temperature.",

      "question": "Why does the material's O2 adsorption capacity increase at higher temperatures?",
      "answer": "The increase in O2 adsorption capacity at higher temperatures is likely due to overcoming kinetic limitations, such as restricted movement of cations or sluggish rearrangement of reduced O2 species, allowing for more O2 to be adsorbed.",

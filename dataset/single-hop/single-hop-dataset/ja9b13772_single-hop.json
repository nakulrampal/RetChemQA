      "question": "What are the key properties of the 1D-AIO structures mentioned in the article?",
      "answer": "The key properties of the 1D-AIO structures include high resistance to heat and moisture, remarkable solubility and solution processability, strong blue-light excitability, and significantly enhanced photoluminescence and quantum yield for certain structures.",

    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the vibrational mode analysis for compounds 1 and 3?",
      "answer": "The vibrational mode analysis for compounds 1 and 3 indicates that compound 1 (μ1-MC) vibrates more, leading to faster non-radiative relaxation and decreased quantum yield, while compound 3 (μ2-DC) has a 'stiffer' Cu-N bond, resulting in less atomic vibrations and higher quantum yield.",

    {
      "question": "What computational method was used for pKa calculation?",
      "answer": "The pKa calculation was performed using density functional theory (B3LYP/6-31+G(d)) as implemented in Gaussian 16, with geometries fully optimized and calculated under the SMD model using water as solvent.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of ionic bonds in the solubility of 1D-AIO compounds?",
      "answer": "The incorporation of ionic bonds in the 1D-AIO compounds significantly enhances their solubility in polar aprotic solvents, making them highly soluble compared to charge-neutral CuI(L) extended network structures.",

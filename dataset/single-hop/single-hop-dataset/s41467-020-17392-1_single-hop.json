    },
    {
      "question": "What does the continuous decrease in G’ above its Tg for PSt-1 suggest about its mechanical behavior?",
      "answer": "It suggests that PSt-1 exhibits flowing melt character at temperatures above its Tg, indicating a more fluid-like than solid-like behavior at these temperatures.",

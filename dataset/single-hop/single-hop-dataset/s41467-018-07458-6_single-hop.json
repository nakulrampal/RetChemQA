    {
      "question": "What is the main focus of the study described in the manuscript?",
      "answer": "The main focus of the study is the cooperative adsorption of carbon disulfide (CS2) in diamine-appended metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), specifically examining the adsorption mechanism, selectivity, and reversibility of CS2 adsorption in these frameworks.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What materials were studied for the adsorption of carbon disulfide?",
      "answer": "Diamine-appended metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) based on Mg2(dobpdc), Mn2(dobpdc), and Zn2(dobpdc) were studied for the adsorption of carbon disulfide (CS2).",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How was the adsorption of CS2 in the MOFs characterized?",
      "answer": "The adsorption of CS2 in the MOFs was characterized using a combination of adsorption isotherms, FTIR analyses, X-ray diffraction studies, and spectroscopic characterizations.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What unique feature of the adsorption mechanism was highlighted in the study?",
      "answer": "The study highlighted a cooperative chemical adsorption mechanism that involves the insertion of CS2 into metal–amine bonds, coupled with proton transfer, leading to the formation of electrostatically paired ammonium dithiocarbamate chains.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "Did the study find that all diamine-appended MOFs showed reversible adsorption of CS2?",
      "answer": "No, the study found that only the Mg-based MOF (mm-2–Mg2(dobpdc)) showed reversible adsorption of CS2, while adsorption in the Mn and Zn analogs was irreversible.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the cooperative adsorption mechanism specific only to carbon disulfide?",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can the diamine-appended MOFs selectively adsorb CS2 in the presence of water?",
      "answer": "Yes, the study demonstrated that mm-2–Mg2(dobpdc) can selectively adsorb CS2 even when fully saturated with water, indicating the chemical specificity of the cooperative adsorption mechanism.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What was a significant finding regarding the coordination chemistry of CS2 in the study?",
      "answer": "A significant finding was the observation of an unprecedented dithiocarbamate coordination mode in the MOFs, which is crucial for the reversibility of CS2 adsorption in mm-2–Mg2(dobpdc).",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "Did the study propose immediate industrial application of the diamine-appended MOFs for CS2 capture?",
      "answer": "False",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What challenges were mentioned regarding the performance of breakthrough experiments with CS2?",
      "answer": "The study mentioned challenges such as the toxicity and corrosive nature of CS2, safety concerns, and potential damage to specialized instrumentation as reasons for not performing breakthrough experiments with CS2.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"

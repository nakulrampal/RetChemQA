    {
      "question": "How does the MOF's structure change upon exposure to air?",
      "answer": "The MOF rapidly oxidizes upon exposure to air, indicated by a color change from orange to bright red, and gradually decomposes under ambient conditions.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens to the MOF upon exposure to NO gas?",
      "answer": "The MOF undergoes an immediate color change from orange to black upon exposure to NO gas, and the black solid gradually turns to red, indicating a reaction.",

      "question": "What is the primary focus of the research article?",
      "answer": "The primary focus of the research article is the design of BINAP-based metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) and their postsynthetic metalation with Rh complexes to create highly active and enantioselective single-site solid catalysts for asymmetric cyclization reactions of 1,6-enynes.",

      "question": "What are the two types of BINAP-based MOFs mentioned in the article?",
      "answer": "The two types of BINAP-based MOFs mentioned are BINAP-MOF (I) and BINAP-dMOF (II).",

      "question": "What reaction does BINAP-MOF (I)·Rh(BF4) efficiently catalyze?",
      "answer": "BINAP-MOF (I)·Rh(BF4) efficiently catalyzes highly enantioselective reductive cyclization of 1,6-enynes.",

    {
      "question": "Why is BINAP-MOF (I)·Rh considered inactive in Pauson–Khand reactions?",
      "answer": "BINAP-MOF (I)·Rh is considered inactive in Pauson–Khand reactions due to the more sterically encumbered nature of these reactions, which likely requires larger open space around the catalytic active site.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does BINAP-dMOF (II)·Rh improve the activity for Pauson–Khand cyclization reactions?",
      "answer": "BINAP-dMOF (II)·Rh improves the activity for Pauson–Khand cyclization reactions by effectively enlarging the open space around the catalytic active site to accommodate highly sterically demanding polycyclic metallocycle transition states/intermediates.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of AgSbF6 in the Alder-ene cycloisomerization reaction catalyzed by BINAP-MOF (I)·Rh?",
      "answer": "AgSbF6 is used to generate the BINAP-MOF (I)·Rh(SbF6) catalyst in situ by treating BINAP-MOF (I)·RhCl with AgSbF6, which is essential for the Alder-ene cycloisomerization activity.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can BINAP-dMOF (II)·Rh be reused in Pauson–Khand cyclization reactions without loss of activity?",
      "answer": "Yes, BINAP-dMOF (II)·Rh can be readily recovered and used three times in Pauson–Khand cyclization reactions without deterioration of yields or enantiomeric excesses.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of using a mixed linker strategy in the synthesis of BINAP-dMOF (II)?",
      "answer": "The mixed linker strategy in the synthesis of BINAP-dMOF (II) is significant because it effectively enlarges the open space around the catalytic active site, which is crucial for accommodating sterically demanding transition states in asymmetric intramolecular cyclization reactions.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the framework of BINAP-MOF stable under asymmetric catalytic reaction conditions?",
      "answer": "Yes, the framework of BINAP-MOF is stable under asymmetric catalytic reaction conditions, as indicated by the similarity of PXRD patterns of the recovered MOF to those of freshly prepared MOF.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "Does the catalytic activity of BINAP-MOF (I)·Rh and BINAP-dMOF (II)·Rh suggest that MOFs can be effective for complex and sterically demanding asymmetric reactions?",

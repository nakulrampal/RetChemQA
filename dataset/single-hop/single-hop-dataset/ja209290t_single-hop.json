    {
      "question": "How was the first substrate introduced into the network crystals?",
      "answer": "By soaking the crystals of network 1 in a saturated toluene solution of substrate 3",

    {
      "question": "What method was used to introduce the second substrate into the crystal?",

    {
      "question": "What was the unique feature of the networked M6L4 cages that facilitated the bimolecular reaction?",

    },
    {
      "question": "Why was the N site of substrate 3 protected in the M6L4 cages?",

    },
    {
      "question": "What was the purpose of tracing the product ratio during the reaction?",

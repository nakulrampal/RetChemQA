      "question": "What is the general synthetic strategy for forming metal-organic nanotubes (MONTs) as described in the text?",
      "answer": "The general synthetic strategy involves employing semirigid double-hinged di-1,2,4-triazoles that adopt a syn conformation between rigid metal chains, with an appropriate anion choice providing a 'capping' of the metal ions, leading to MONT formation.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the choice of metal ion affect the local geometry at the metal center in MONT synthesis?",
      "answer": "The local geometry at the metal center depends on the metal ion employed, with Cu(I) centers adopting a tetrahedral geometry, Ag(I) centers adopting a seesaw geometry, and Cu(II) centers adopting a square-pyramidal geometry.",

    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the adsorption properties of MONTs?",

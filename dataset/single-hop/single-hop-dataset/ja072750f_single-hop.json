      "question": "What is the general procedure for complex formation in the synthesis of lanthanide complexes?",
      "answer": "Under argon, a solution of TREN-1,2-HOIQO (1.0 equiv) in MeOH was treated with solid LnCl3·6H2O (1.0 equiv) or LnCl3 (anhydrous) (1.0 equiv), followed by pyridine and heated to reflux overnight. The resulting fine suspension was cooled to ambient temperature, the precipitate was collected on a filter and washed with MeOH. After drying in vacuo at 50 °C (bath temp) for 6 h, the lanthanide complexes [Ln(TREN-1,2-HOIQO)(H2O)]·xMeOH·yH2O were obtained in analytically pure form as powders that were soluble in DMF, DMSO, and, only sparingly, in MeOH.",

      "question": "Why are hydrogen atoms of water molecules not refined in the crystal structure determination?",
      "answer": "The hydrogen atoms of water molecules are not refined in the crystal structure determination because their positions cannot be unambiguously assigned due to their small size and high mobility.",

      "question": "What is the role of DMF in the crystallization process of lanthanide complexes?",

    {
      "question": "How does the lanthanide contraction affect the geometry of lanthanide complexes with multidentate ligands?",
      "answer": "The lanthanide contraction results in a decrease in the size of the lanthanide ions from La to Lu, which leads to a quadratic decrease in the sum of all bond lengths Ln−X (X = N, O) and affects the geometry of the complexes by causing variations in individual bond lengths and distances within the coordination sphere.",

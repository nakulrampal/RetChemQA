These anions exhibit an electronic structure between that of a ketenyl anion and ethynolate, but also have enhanced stability, making them valuable reagents in organic synthesis. The ketenyl anions react selectively with a range of electrophiles at the carbon atom, offering high-yielding and versatile access to ketenes and related compounds.",

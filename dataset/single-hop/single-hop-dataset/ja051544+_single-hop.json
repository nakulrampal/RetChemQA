      "question": "How does the ionic radius of alkali metal ions influence the solid-state structures of 2Li2·(DME)2, 2Na2·(DME)3, and 2K2·(DME)3?",
      "answer": "The ionic radii of the alkali metal ions influence the solid-state structures by determining the distance between the cyclopentadienyl rings of the coordinating ferrocene fragments, with smaller ions allowing for closer distances.",

      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What was the role of electrostatic potential surfaces (EPS) in the study?",
      "answer": "Electrostatic potential surfaces were used to rationalize differences in the degree of cation−π binding among ferrocene and benzene by comparing the maximum electrostatic potential above the center of the aromatic.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },

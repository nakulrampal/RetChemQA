    },
    {
      "question": "What happens to the pore volume of ZIF-8 at 1.47 GPa?",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is the increase in pore volume of ZIF-8 at high pressure significant?",
      "answer": "Because it allows for more solvent to enter the nanopore and increases the size of the narrow channels, resulting in an overall increase in porous volume.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does the application of pressure affect the solvent content in ZIF-8?",

    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the phase transition observed in ZIF-8 at high pressure?",

    {
      "question": "How does the crystal structure of ZIF-8 change at 1.47 GPa?",

    {
      "question": "What leads to the formation of polymeric cages PC-1 and PC-2?",
      "answer": "The formation of polymeric cages PC-1 and PC-2 is achieved when ligand 1 and Zn­(acac)2 are mixed in the presence of relatively small cations Cp2Co+ and TEA+, leading to one-dimensional abacus-like cage polymers.",

      "question": "Do the cations reside inside or outside the cavities of Cage-3, Cage-5, PC-1, and PC-2?",
      "answer": "In Cage-3 and Cage-5, the TBA+ and DMV2+ cations lie outside the cavities, while in PC-1 and PC-2, the TEA+ and Cp2Co+ cations are involved in the structure with Cp2Co+ residing inside the cavities formed between two neighboring cage subunits.",

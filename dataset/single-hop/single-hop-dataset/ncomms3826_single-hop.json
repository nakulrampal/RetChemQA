      "question": "What is the spin crossover (SCO) effect?",
      "answer": "The spin crossover (SCO) effect is a reversible transformation between a high-spin (HS) and a low-spin (LS) state in transition metal complexes, often triggered by changes in temperature, pressure, or light irradiation.",

    {
        "question": "What phenomenon is common in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)?",
        "answer": "Interpenetration, the entwining of multiple lattices, is common in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs).",
        "difficulty": "easy",
        "type": "factual"
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the effect of interpenetration on MOF pores?",
        "answer": "Interpenetration influences the size and shape of MOF pores, which in turn modulates their molecular sieving and storage properties.",
        "difficulty": "medium",
        "type": "factual"
    },
    {
        "question": "What is autocatenation in the context of MOFs?",
        "answer": "Autocatenation is a transformation of non-interpenetrated lattices into doubly interpenetrated frameworks via progressively higher degrees of interpenetration that involves no external reagents.",
        "difficulty": "medium",
        "type": "factual"
    },
    {
        "question": "How can the degree of partial interpenetration in MOFs be controlled?",
        "answer": "The degree of partial interpenetration in MOFs can be controlled during synthesis by the reaction time and by solvent composition.",
        "difficulty": "hard",
        "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
        "question": "What triggers autocatenation in MOFs?",
        "answer": "Autocatenation in MOFs can be triggered either thermally or by shear forces.",
        "difficulty": "medium",
        "type": "factual"
    },
    {
        "question": "True or False: The ligand used to construct the MOFs is achiral.",
        "answer": "False",
        "difficulty": "easy",
        "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of second harmonic generation microscopy in the study of MOFs?",
        "answer": "Second harmonic generation microscopy serves as a sensitive probe of framework organization because its efficiency depends strongly on point group symmetry.",
        "difficulty": "hard",
        "type": "factual"
    },
    {
        "question": "True or False: All MOFs with controlled degrees of interpenetration allow rapid mass transport and high surface area.",
        "answer": "True",
        "difficulty": "medium",
        "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the space group in determining the structure of MOFs?",
        "answer": "The space group is significant in determining the structure of MOFs as it defines the symmetry and arrangement of the lattice in the crystal structure.",
        "difficulty": "hard",
        "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
        "question": "True or False: The degree of interpenetration in MOFs is always fixed and cannot be modified after synthesis.",
        "answer": "False",
        "difficulty": "easy",
        "type": "True or False"

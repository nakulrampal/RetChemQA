    {
      "question": "How was the disorder in the crystal structure addressed during the refinement process?",
      "answer": "The disorder in the crystal structure was addressed by using the Squeeze program in PLATON to account for diffusely scattering species and by applying restraints and modeling disordered components.",

    {
      "question": "What was the purpose of using the Squeeze program in the refinement process?",
      "answer": "The Squeeze program was used to account for diffusely scattering species in the interstitial regions of the crystal structure, which could not be modeled due to extensive disorder.",

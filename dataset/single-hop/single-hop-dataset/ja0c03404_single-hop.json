      "question": "How does the net-clipping approach work for predicting the topologies of MOFs?",
      "answer": "The net-clipping approach works by rational deconstruction of edge-transitive nets comprising higher-connected molecular building blocks (MBBs), specifically by splitting 4-connected (4-c) nodes into two 3-connected (3-c) nodes and then clipping their two diagonally connecting groups.",

      "question": "What was the reason for the high R-values in the refinement of CAU-17's crystal structure?",
      "answer": "The high R-values were due to significant beam damage to the crystal throughout data acquisition and the presence of disordered guest species in the pores that were not accounted for in the crystal structure model.",

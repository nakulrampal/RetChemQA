      "question": "What is the effect of anions on the self-assembly and interconversion of metallacyclophanes?",
      "answer": "Anions play a crucial role in the self-assembly and interconversion of metallacyclophanes, acting as templates that influence the formation of specific cyclic structures.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "Which anions favor the formation of molecular squares with Ni(II) and Zn(II) ions?",
      "answer": "The tetrahedral anions [BF4]- and [ClO4]- favor the formation of molecular squares with Ni(II) and Zn(II) ions.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of [SbF6]- anion in the formation of molecular pentagons?",
      "answer": "The [SbF6]- anion leads to the exclusive formation of a molecular pentagon due to its size and shape, which is appropriate to occupy a cavity slightly larger than that of the square.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can the molecular pentagon be converted to a square?",
      "answer": "Yes, the molecular pentagon can be converted to a square by adding an excess of [BF4]-, [ClO4]-, or [I]- anions to solutions of the pentagon.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the molecular square more stable than the pentagon?",
      "answer": "Yes, the molecular square is more stable than the pentagon, as evidenced by the facile conversion of the pentagon to the square under milder conditions.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can [IO4]- anions replace [ClO4]- anions inside the cavity of a molecular square?",
      "answer": "No, larger tetrahedral anions such as [IO4]- cannot replace [ClO4]- inside the cavity, but the linear [Br3]- anion is capable of doing so.",

      "question": "Are anion-π interactions operative in dictating the outcome of reactions forming cyclic products?",
      "answer": "Yes, anion-π interactions may be operative in dictating the outcome of reactions forming cyclic products, as suggested by short distances between the centroids of tetrazine rings and the O/F atoms of encapsulated anions.",

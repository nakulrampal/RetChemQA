    {
      "question": "What are zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs)?",
      "answer": "Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) are porous crystalline materials with tetrahedral networks that resemble those of zeolites, where transition metals (Zn, Co) replace tetrahedrally coordinated atoms (e.g., Si), and imidazolate links replace oxygen bridges.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What makes ZIFs chemically and thermally stable?",
      "answer": "The chemical and thermal stability of ZIFs is attributed to their structure, which includes a high density of transition metal ions and the flexibility offered by functionalized organic links.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: ZIF-95 and ZIF-100 have structures of a scale and complexity previously unknown in zeolites.",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the angle formed by imidazolates (IMs) when bridging transition metals in ZIFs?",
      "answer": "The angle formed by imidazolates when bridging transition metals in ZIFs is close to the 145u Si-O-Si bond angle in zeolites, facilitating the formation of ZIF structures reminiscent of those exhibited by zeolites.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does functionalization of IM linkers contribute to the structural diversity of ZIFs?",
      "answer": "Functionalization of IM linkers contributes to the structural diversity of ZIFs by directing the formation of specific ZIF structures through link-link interactions.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The structure of ZIF-95 is tetragonal.",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of anhydrous Zn(O3SCF3)2 in the synthesis of ZIF-100?",
      "answer": "Anhydrous Zn(O3SCF3)2 is used in place of Zn(NO3)2Â·4H2O to achieve less hydrated conditions, promoting the crystallization of ZIF-100.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why are ZIFs considered promising materials for carbon dioxide capture?",
      "answer": "ZIFs are considered promising materials for carbon dioxide capture due to their selective adsorption of CO2, high thermal and chemical stability, and ease of fabrication.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: ZIF-100 has a larger primitive cell volume than MIL-101.",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the pore sizes in ZIF-95 and ZIF-100 for their application in gas storage and separation?",
      "answer": "The significance of the pore sizes in ZIF-95 and ZIF-100 lies in their ability to combine huge cavities with highly constricted windows, making them suitable for selective gas capture and storage, particularly for carbon dioxide.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"

      "question": "What is the primary challenge in trace CO2 capture that SIFSIX-18-Ni-β addresses?",
      "answer": "The primary challenge in trace CO2 capture that SIFSIX-18-Ni-β addresses is the need for a material that combines high affinity for CO2 with low affinity for H2O, enabling effective CO2 capture under both dry and humid conditions.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the CO2 binding site in SIFSIX-18-Ni-β compare to that in enzymes like RuBisCo?",
      "answer": "The CO2 binding site in SIFSIX-18-Ni-β is similar to that in enzymes like RuBisCo in that it features a hydrophobic pocket that concentrates CO2. However, SIFSIX-18-Ni-β offers additional advantages such as very high CO2/O2 selectivity, fast CO2 sorption kinetics, and a high density of binding sites, making it more efficient for industrial CO2 capture.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: SIFSIX-18-Ni-β exhibits negligible change in performance over 100 adsorption/desorption cycles under conditions of 1.0 bar CO2 at 308 K.",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What unique feature does SIFSIX-18-Ni-β's CO2 binding site have that contributes to its strong CO2 capture performance?",
      "answer": "SIFSIX-18-Ni-β's CO2 binding site features a combination of a relatively strong C···F interaction with SIFSIX moieties and multiple weak C-H···O interactions from methyl groups, creating a unique pocket that enables strong and selective CO2 capture.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the presence of moisture affect the CO2 capture performance of SIFSIX-18-Ni-β compared to other sorbents?",
      "answer": "SIFSIX-18-Ni-β's CO2 capture performance is much less affected by the presence of moisture compared to other sorbents, maintaining effective CO2 capture under both dry and humid conditions, unlike other materials whose performance significantly deteriorates in the presence of moisture.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The CO2 saturation uptake of SIFSIX-18-Ni-β under 74% RH conditions is higher than that of NbOFFIVE-1-Ni for 3000 ppm CO2/N2 mixtures.",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What method was used to synthesize SIFSIX-18-Ni?",
      "answer": "SIFSIX-18-Ni was synthesized by hydrothermal treatment of NiSiF6.xH2O and 3,3',5,5'-tetramethyl-1H,1'H-4,4'-bipyrazole in water, followed by vacuum filtration, drying, methanol washing, and heating under vacuum to induce a phase transition to SIFSIX-18-Ni-β.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The performance of SIFSIX-18-Ni-β in CO2 capture is unaffected by the accelerated stability protocol adopted from the pharmaceutical industry.",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of the hydrophobic pocket in SIFSIX-18-Ni-β's CO2 binding site?",
      "answer": "The hydrophobic pocket in SIFSIX-18-Ni-β's CO2 binding site concentrates CO2 and enables selective capture by providing a combination of strong and weak interactions that are optimized for CO2 but not for other gases like O2, N2, or H2O, thereby enhancing its selectivity and efficiency in CO2 capture.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: SIFSIX-18-Ni-β's CO2 capture performance is superior to that of ZIF-8 under both dry and humid conditions for trace CO2 capture.",
      "answer": "True",

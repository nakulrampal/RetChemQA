    },
    {
      "question": "How does the presence of chiral centers in NJU-Bai9 influence its overall structure?",
      "answer": "The presence of chiral centers, resulting from the twisting of BCP ligands around Zn atoms, leads to the formation of enantiotropic MDTC cages, which are crucial for the assembly of NJU-Bai9's three-dimensional network and its achiral nature.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the stabilization of NJU-Bai9's structure occur?",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does the solvent play in the formation of NJU-Bai9?",

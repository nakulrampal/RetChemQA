    },
    {
      "question": "How does the thermal stability of compound 1 compare to other copper azide-based primary explosives?",
      "answer": "Compound 1 has a decomposition temperature of 265°C, which is significantly higher than those of other copper azide-based primary explosives, making it the compound with the highest decomposition temperature among copper azide-based primary explosives.",

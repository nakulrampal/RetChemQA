      "answer": "For BUT-12, ZrCl4, H3CTTA, and formic acid were used in a DMF solvent at 120 °C for 48 hours. For BUT-13, ZrCl4, H3TTNA, and acetic acid were used in a DMF solvent at 120 °C for 72 hours.",

      "question": "How does the introduction of methyl groups into the ligands of BUT-12 and BUT-13 affect the water stability and adsorption ability of these MOFs?",
      "answer": "The introduction of methyl groups into the ligands increases the hydrophobicity of the frameworks, which weakens their interactions with water molecules, thus increasing their adsorption ability for antibiotics and nitroaromatics.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of the adsorption process in the detection sensitivity of BUT-12 and BUT-13 towards specific analytes?",
      "answer": "The adsorption process plays an important role in the preconcentration of analytes in the pores of the MOFs, which makes the analytes contact with MOFs more sufficient, thus enhancing the detection efficiency.",

      "question": "True or False: The structures of BUT-12 and BUT-13 were determined using single-crystal X-ray diffraction.",
      "answer": "False. While the structure of BUT-12 was determined using single-crystal X-ray diffraction, the structure of BUT-13 was computationally generated due to difficulties in obtaining well enough diffraction data.",

      "question": "What is the estimated detection limit of BUT-12 for TNP and how does it compare to BUT-13?",

    {
      "question": "How do the surface areas and pore volumes of BUT-12 and BUT-13 compare to other water-stable MOFs?",
      "answer": "BUT-12 and BUT-13 have surface areas and pore volumes that are comparable or even higher than those of other water-stable MOFs, with BUT-13 being one of the most porous water-stable MOFs reported so far.",

      "question": "True or False: The quenching efficiency of BUT-12 and BUT-13 towards nitrofurazone (NZF) and trinitrophenol (TNP) is solely due to photoinduced electron transfer.",
      "answer": "False. The quenching efficiency is attributed to a combining effect from electron and energy transfers in the host–guest systems.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What method was used to computationally generate the structure of BUT-13?",
      "answer": "The structure of BUT-13 was computationally generated by combining the cell parameters from experimental single-crystal X-ray diffraction and the-a topological template, followed by optimization using the Universal force field (UFF) in Materials Studio software.",

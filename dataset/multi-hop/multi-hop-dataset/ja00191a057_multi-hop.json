          "answer": "The shift in TLC Rf values from 0.3 to 0.6 suggests an increase in the polarity of the compounds, as a higher Rf value typically indicates that the compound is more polar and thus travels further on the TLC plate.",

          "answer": "The use of different solvents (C6D6 vs CDCI3) for 1H NMR analysis can impact the interpretation of the chemical environment in the synthesized compounds by altering the chemical shifts observed. Different solvents can have varying effects on the electron density around hydrogen atoms, thus affecting their resonance frequency and the observed chemical shifts.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does the presence of enantiopure camphoric acid affect the crystallization of metal organic frameworks?",
      "answer": "The presence of enantiopure camphoric acid induces absolute bulk chirality in the system, leading to the exclusive formation of either positive or negative homohelical coordination polymers.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The synthesis of homochiral coordination polymers can be achieved without the use of chiral induction agents.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What experimental technique is used to confirm the absolute configurations of the synthesized coordination polymers?",
      "answer": "Solid-state circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy is used to confirm the absolute configurations of the synthesized coordination polymers.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the absence of camphoric acid influence the crystallization process of coordination polymers?",
      "answer": "In the absence of camphoric acid, the crystallization process results in the formation of a conglomerate containing both enantiomorphs of the coordination polymer.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The thermal stability of the synthesized coordination polymers is below 100 Â°C.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What is the observed effect of using different enantiomers of camphoric acid in the synthesis of coordination polymers?",
      "answer": "Using different enantiomers of camphoric acid directs the exclusive formation of coordination polymers with either positive or negative homohelicity.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"

    },
    {
      "question": "How does the synthesis approach of ALF-2 differ from that of ALF-1 in terms of ionic liquid's role?",
      "answer": "In the synthesis of ALF-2, the ionic liquid only serves as the solvent, while a separate compound, tetrapropylammonium cations, acts as the structure-directing agent, unlike in ALF-1 where the ionic liquid has a dual role.",

    {
      "question": "Why are ALF-1 and ALF-2 considered homochiral despite the diamond net being achiral?",
      "answer": "ALF-1 and ALF-2 are considered homochiral because of the incorporation of enantiopure camphorate ligands, which introduce chirality into the otherwise achiral diamond net structure.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does the acidity/basicity of the synthesis mixture play in the formation of ALF-4 and ALF-5?",
      "answer": "The acidity/basicity of the synthesis mixture influences the connectivity of the framework, with a lower basicity leading to partial protonation of camphoric acid and a decrease in connectivity from 4 to 3, as seen in the synthesis of ALF-4 and ALF-5.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What is the effect of using a separate structure-directing agent in the synthesis of ALF-2?",
      "answer": "Using a separate structure-directing agent in the synthesis of ALF-2 leads to the selection of Pr4N+ cations into the 4-connected diamond framework, while suppressing the structure-directing effect of the ionic liquid.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of achieving homochirality in low-connectivity framework materials?",
      "answer": "Achieving homochirality in low-connectivity framework materials is significant because it opens up new routes for the synthesis of materials with potential applications in enantioselective catalysis, separation, and optical devices.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the use of ionic liquids contribute to the diversity of framework materials synthesized?",
      "answer": "The use of ionic liquids contributes to the diversity of framework materials synthesized by serving different roles such as solvent, cationic structure-directing agent, and encapsulating both cations and anions, enabling the creation of materials with various compositions and topologies.",

    {
      "question": "Why is the synthesis of 3D homochiral low-connectivity framework materials challenging?",
      "answer": "The synthesis of 3D homochiral low-connectivity framework materials is challenging due to the lack of a generalized synthetic approach for preparing materials that are stoichiometrically and topologically similar to zeolites, which are traditionally achiral.",

    {
      "question": "What role does the choice of metal and ligand play in the synthesis of homochiral 3D zeolite-like tetrahedral framework materials?",
      "answer": "The choice of metal and ligand is crucial in the synthesis of homochiral 3D zeolite-like tetrahedral framework materials as it determines the formation of bidentate chelating bonds and the overall framework topology, enabling the creation of low-connectivity materials.",

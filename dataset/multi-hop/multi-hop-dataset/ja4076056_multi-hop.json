      "answer": "[Ru2II,III(CH3CO2)4Cl] (1.42 g, 3.0 mmol) and 4-chloro-2-methoxybenzoic acid (2.04 g, 12.0 mmol) were refluxed in 150 ml of MeOH for 48 h. After cooling, Zn powder (392 mg, 6.0 mmol) was added and refluxed for 24h. The solution was then filtered, and the residue was dissolved in 100 ml of THF and refluxed for 24h. The solution was filtered again and layered with n-hexane to obtain brown crystals after one week (2.30 g, Yield: 75%).",

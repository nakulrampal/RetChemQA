      "question": "What are the synthesis conditions for compound 1?",
      "answer": "Co(CH3COO)2·4H2O (0.249 g, 1.0 mmol) and Gd(ClO4)3 (2.0 mL, 2.0 mmol) were added to a mixture of 5 mL deionized water and 15 mL anhydrous ethanol. The solution was heated to about 70 oC and NaOH solution (aq. 1.0 mol L–1) was added to adjust the pH to 6–7. The solution was refluxed for 2 hours, then filtered while hot. Evaporation of the filtrate under ambient conditions afforded pink block-shaped crystals.",

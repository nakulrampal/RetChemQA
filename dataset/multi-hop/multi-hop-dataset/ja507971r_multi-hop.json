      "question": "What effect does the concentration of H2bdc have on the formation of the box superstructure?",
      "answer": "When the concentration of H2bdc is increased to 100 mM, hollow particles and tiny crystals are obtained. Decreasing the concentration to 25 mM results in only tiny crystals, suggesting insufficient recrystallization to maintain the cuboid morphology.",

      "question": "What is the impact of the crystal size on the sorption properties of the solid-solution PCP?",
      "answer": "The rate of carbon dioxide sorption for the box superstructure is much faster than that for the micrometer crystals, indicating the effect of crystal size on the kinetics of carbon dioxide uptake.",

      "answer": "The framework of the solid-solution PCP is deformed in response to the removal of guest molecules from the pores, reducing the void space and stabilizing the evacuated phase, which contributes to its larger storage capacity for carbon dioxide.",

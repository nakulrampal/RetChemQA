    {
      "question": "What are the synthesis conditions for HUST-2?",
      "answer": "HUST-2 is synthesized by adding 20 mg NiCl2·6H2O to the CH3CN (3 mL) solution, then immersing 5 mg HUST-1 in a small bowl into the solution, and heating at 353 K for seven days.",

    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the 'SQUEEZE' procedure in the refinement of HUST-1 to HUST-4 structures?",
      "answer": "The 'SQUEEZE' procedure is used to account for highly disordered solvent molecules in the crystal structures of HUST-1 to HUST-4, which cannot be explicitly modeled.",

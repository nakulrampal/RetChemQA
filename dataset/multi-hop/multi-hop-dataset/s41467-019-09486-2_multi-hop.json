      "question": "What are the conditions required for the dimerization of Thy molecules in SION-19?",
      "answer": "The conditions required for the dimerization of Thy molecules in SION-19 include a loading of 40-45% Thy, fulfillment of both the Woodward-Hoffmann and Schmidt rules, and exposure to UV light (254 nm) for 24 hours.",

    {
      "question": "What is the role of adenine (Ade) in the structure of SION-19?",
      "answer": "In SION-19, adenine (Ade) acts as a deprotonated and bridging tridentate ligand, facilitating the formation of octahedral cages with ZnII ions and directing the orientation of Thy molecules for dimerization.",

      "question": "How does the presence of [NH2Me2]+ cations affect the porosity of SION-19?",
      "answer": "The presence of [NH2Me2]+ cations in SION-19 preferentially localizes near the carboxylate groups in the acid-pores, which does not compete with other guest molecules for Ade binding in the base pore, thus affecting the porosity distribution.",

    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the Woodward-Hoffmann and Schmidt rules in the context of Thy dimerization within SION-19?",
      "answer": "The Woodward-Hoffmann and Schmidt rules are significant as they govern the orientation and proximity of Thy molecules within SION-19, ensuring that the C5–C6 and C5′–C6′ double bonds are properly aligned and close enough for dimerization to occur upon UV irradiation.",

      "question": "What computational methods were used to study the interaction between Thy and Ade in SION-19?",
      "answer": "Computational methods used to study the interaction between Thy and Ade in SION-19 included DFT calculations for binding energy and geometry optimization, and classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the dynamic behavior of Thy within the pores.",

      "answer": "The presence of Thy<>Thy dimers in the SION-19@UV-Thy samples was confirmed using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI/MS), by comparing the elution times, parent ion peaks, and PRM fragmentation patterns with those of Thy<>Thy standards.",

      "question": "What is the primary structural difference between kgmSMe and kgmOMe MOFs?",
      "answer": "The primary structural difference between kgmSMe and kgmOMe MOFs is the substituent group attached to the isophthalate unit; kgmSMe has a -SMe (methylthio) group, while kgmOMe has an -OMe (methoxy) group.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the synthesis temperature affect the formation of kgmSMe and kgmOMe?",
      "answer": "The synthesis of both kgmSMe and kgmOMe MOFs occurs at 20 Â°C, indicating that the formation of these MOFs is conducted at room temperature, which does not specify a direct effect of temperature on their formation.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does pyridine play in the synthesis of kgmSMe?",
      "answer": "Pyridine acts as a solvent and potentially as a base or coordinating agent in the synthesis of kgmSMe, facilitating the complexation of 5-methylthioisophthalate with Cu2+.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can kgmSMe undergo reversible interlayer expansion, and what solvents are involved?",
      "answer": "Yes, kgmSMe undergoes a stepwise and reversible interlayer expansion when immersed in solvents like THF and dioxane, transitioning through bilayer-expanded (state II) to monolayer-expanded (state III) states.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the solvent's surface tension in the interlayer expansion of kgmSMe?",
      "answer": "The solvent's surface tension is significant in the interlayer expansion of kgmSMe, as it correlates with the observed expansion profiles, indicating that solvents with specific surface tension values are more effective in inducing full expansion to the monolayer-expanded state (state III).",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the exfoliation process of kgmSMe into nanosheets occur?",
      "answer": "The exfoliation process of kgmSMe into nanosheets occurs by gently stirring expanded kgmSMe crystals in appropriate solvents like MeTHF and dioxane for 24 hours, leading to the preferential formation of bilayer and monolayer nanosheets, respectively.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the effect of substituting -SMe with -OMe on the solvent-induced expansion of MOFs?",
      "answer": "Substituting -SMe with -OMe in MOFs affects their solvent-induced expansion behavior; kgmSMe expands in THF and dioxane, while kgmOMe expands only in DMF and DEF, indicating that the electron-donating nature of the substituent influences the MOF's interaction with solvents.",

      "type": "reasoning"

      "question": "Is the interlayer expansion and contraction of kgmSMe reversible?",

      "question": "Does the synthesis of kgmSMe require a temperature higher than room temperature?",

    },
    {
      "question": "Can kgmOMe be exfoliated into nanosheets using the same solvents as kgmSMe?",
      "answer": "False",

      "question": "Does the presence of -SMe or -OMe groups in MOFs affect their thermal stability?",

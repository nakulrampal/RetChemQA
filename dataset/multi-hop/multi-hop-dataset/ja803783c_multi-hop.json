      "question": "What is the relationship between the synthesis conditions and the resulting structure of MOP-14 and MOP-15?",
      "answer": "The synthesis conditions for MOP-14 and MOP-15 involve the use of specific organic linkers (Br-mBDC for MOP-14 and NH2-mBDC for MOP-15) that control the dimensionality and topology of the resulting structures. MOP-14 and MOP-15 are isoreticular, differing only in the functional group attached to the benzene ring of the linker.",

      "question": "How does the linker angle influence the structure of MOF-601 to MOF-603?",
      "answer": "The linker angle in 2,2'-R-BPDC (R = CN, Me, and I) used for MOF-601 to MOF-603 is almost perpendicular due to bulky functional groups, leading to an NbO framework topology. The twist angle plays a crucial role in determining the dimensionality and topology, with MOF-601 to MOF-603 designed to have an NbO framework by employing linkers with suitable bend and twist angles.",

      "answer": "Interpenetration in MOF-601, MOF-602, and MOF-603 does not always negatively impact sorption properties. It can reinforce framework stability, even with long links, and contribute to permanent porosity. MOF-601 and MOF-602 exhibit large internal void spaces despite their interpenetrated structures, indicating that interpenetration can help maintain porosity and structural integrity.",

      "question": "How does the functionality of organic linkers affect the gas adsorption properties of MOFs?",
      "answer": "The functionality of organic linkers in MOFs, such as the cyano groups in MOF-601, can significantly influence gas adsorption properties. For example, MOF-601 exhibits a stronger interaction with CO2 due to quadrupole-quadrupole interactions between the cyano groups and CO2, affecting the CO2 uptake capacity. This demonstrates that the chemical functionalities of the linkers can impact the interaction with gas molecules and the overall adsorption performance.",

      "answer": "The solvent plays a crucial role in the synthesis of MOPs and MOFs by affecting the crystallization process and the inclusion of solvent molecules within the structure. For example, in the synthesis of MOP-14, MOP-15, MOP-23, and MOP-24, different solvents such as DMF, DEF, and NMP are used, which are included as terminal ligands or within the void spaces of the structures. The choice of solvent can influence the formation of the desired structure, the stability of the framework, and the properties of the resulting MOPs and MOFs.",

      "question": "How do the synthesis conditions affect the gas adsorption behavior of MOF-601 compared to MOF-602?",
      "answer": "The synthesis conditions, including the choice of functional groups on the organic linkers (CN for MOF-601 and Me for MOF-602), affect the gas adsorption behavior by influencing the interaction with gas molecules. MOF-601 exhibits a steeper uptake of CO2 in the low-pressure region compared to MOF-602, indicating stronger interactions with CO2 due to the presence of cyano groups. This demonstrates how synthesis conditions can tailor the functionality of MOFs for specific gas adsorption properties.",

      "question": "What is the significance of the linker angle in determining the structure of MOF-114?",
      "answer": "The linker angle in MOF-114 is significant because it determines the dimensionality and topology of the resulting structure. By using a linker with an in-plane bend close to 90°, MOF-114 achieves a 1-periodic structure. The specific angle of the linker influences how the square units are connected, leading to the formation of a structure with Zn square units linked in a manner that produces a 1-D chain. This highlights the importance of linker geometry in the design and synthesis of MOFs with desired structural features.",

      "question": "How does the synthesis of MOF-601 demonstrate control over the structure's topology?",
      "answer": "The synthesis of MOF-601 demonstrates control over the structure's topology by employing 2,2'-CNBPDC linkers with a specific twist angle that leads to an NbO framework topology. The deliberate choice of linkers with almost perpendicular angles due to bulky functional groups results in a structure where the square units are almost perpendicular to each other, forming the desired NbO net. This showcases how synthesis conditions, particularly the selection of linkers with suitable geometric properties, can be used to achieve precise control over the topology of MOFs.",

      "question": "What role does solvent exchange play in the activation of MOF-601 for gas adsorption measurements?",
      "answer": "Solvent exchange plays a critical role in the activation of MOF-601 for gas adsorption measurements by removing free guest molecules from the structure without causing structural decomposition. The process involves replacing the original solvent molecules with THF and then evacuating the THF to create a porous material capable of adsorbing gases. This step is essential for ensuring that the MOF's pores are accessible for gas adsorption, thereby enabling the measurement of its sorption properties.",

      "question": "What was the result of the breakthrough experiments using Ni2(m-dobdc) for the separation of n-butene isomers?",
      "answer": "The breakthrough experiments using Ni2(m-dobdc) showed that 2-butenes broke through the adsorption bed first, followed by 1-butene, indicating selective adsorption of 1-butene over the 2-butenes under multicomponent conditions.",

      "question": "According to the text, what challenges were encountered during the Rietveld refinement of powder X-ray diffraction patterns for Co2(m-dobdc) dosed with trans-2-butene?",
      "answer": "During the Rietveld refinement of powder X-ray diffraction patterns for Co2(m-dobdc) dosed with trans-2-butene, challenges included the inability to fit the excess electron density with defined atom positions, resulting in unreasonable occupancies and bond distances.",

      "question": "What are the implications of the observed selectivity for 1-butene over 2-butenes in Co2(m-dobdc) and Ni2(m-dobdc) frameworks for industrial applications?",
      "answer": "The observed selectivity for 1-butene over 2-butenes in Co2(m-dobdc) and Ni2(m-dobdc) frameworks implies potential for these materials in developing more efficient and cost-effective separation processes for butene isomers, which are important for various industrial applications including the production of poly-1-butene and high-density polyethylene.",

      "question": "What were the key findings from the liquid phase multicomponent adsorption experiments using Ni2(m-dobdc) for butene isomers?",
      "answer": "The key findings from the liquid phase multicomponent adsorption experiments using Ni2(m-dobdc) for butene isomers included comparable selectivity for 1-butene over cis-2-butene to that determined from single-component isotherms using IAST, and a decrease in selectivity for 1-butene over trans-2-butene, suggesting significant adsorbate–adsorbate interactions.",

      "answer": "False. The study found that particularly Co2(m-dobdc) and Ni2(m-dobdc) frameworks showed high selectivity for 1-butene over the 2-butenes, indicating that not all MOFs tested may have exhibited high selectivity.",

      "question": "What is the primary focus of the study conducted by Shun Sakaida and colleagues?",
      "answer": "The primary focus of the study is the fabrication of porous coordination frameworks in thin-film forms, specifically investigating a coordination framework that exhibits dynamic guest-sorption behaviour in a nanometre-sized thin-film form.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What unique property does the coordination framework {Fe(py)2[Pt(CN)4]} exhibit when downsized to a thin film?",
      "answer": "When downsized to a thin film, the coordination framework {Fe(py)2[Pt(CN)4]} exhibits a dynamic guest-sorption behaviour, showing a clear guest uptake with a structural transformation of the gate-opening type.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the guest-uptake property of the coordination framework {Fe(py)2[Pt(CN)4]} change when it is in a bulk state compared to a nanometre-sized thin film?",
      "answer": "In the bulk state, the coordination framework {Fe(py)2[Pt(CN)4]} exhibits no significant guest uptake, but in a nanometre-sized thin film, it shows a specific response to guests and undergoes an anisotropic structural transformation.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What method was used to fabricate the thin film of the coordination framework {Fe(py)2[Pt(CN)4]}?",
      "answer": "The thin film of the coordination framework {Fe(py)2[Pt(CN)4]} was fabricated using the layer-by-layer (LbL) method on a gold substrate.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What was observed in the synchrotron XRD measurements of the thin film {Fe(py)2[Pt(CN)4]}?",
      "answer": "The synchrotron XRD measurements of the thin film {Fe(py)2[Pt(CN)4]} confirmed its crystallinity and preferentially oriented nature on the substrate surface, with diffraction patterns indicating periodicity of the 2D layer and interlayer spacing.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What effect does increasing the thickness of the thin film {Fe(py)2[Pt(CN)4]} have on its gate-opening behaviour?",
      "answer": "Increasing the thickness of the thin film {Fe(py)2[Pt(CN)4]} suppresses the gate-opening behaviour, demonstrating the existence of a crystal-downsizing effect on the coordination framework's dynamic structural response to guests.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The coordination framework {Fe(py)2[Pt(CN)4]} in its bulk state exhibits a dynamic structural transformation similar to its thin film form.",
      "answer": "False. In its bulk state, the coordination framework {Fe(py)2[Pt(CN)4]} does not exhibit a significant guest uptake or dynamic structural transformation, unlike its thin film form.",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What potential applications are envisioned for the coordination framework {Fe(py)2[Pt(CN)4]} thin films based on their unique properties?",
      "answer": "The coordination framework {Fe(py)2[Pt(CN)4]} thin films are envisioned for potential applications in chemoswitching or sensing applications, gas separation, catalytic devices, and integrated systems of functionality due to their unique guest-responsive properties.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The coordination framework {Fe(py)2[Pt(CN)4]} thin films exhibit a uniform guest uptake regardless of the guest molecule size.",
      "answer": "False. The coordination framework {Fe(py)2[Pt(CN)4]} thin films exhibit a guest-responsive structural change that depends on the guest molecule size, with different behaviours observed for small and large guest molecules.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What challenges are associated with creating metal-organic framework (MOF) thin films with high crystallinity and well-controlled growth directions?",
      "answer": "Creating MOF thin films with high crystallinity and well-controlled growth directions is challenging due to difficulties in characterization using XRD, which can provide direct structural evidence for MOF thin films, and the need for precise control over film thickness and crystalline orientation.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"

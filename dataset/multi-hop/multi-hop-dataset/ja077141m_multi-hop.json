      "question": "What are the unique properties of DPP that make it an effective ligand for metal ion complexation?",
      "answer": "DPP's unique properties include its ability to form five-membered chelate rings, favoring complexation with metal ions of an ionic radius close to 1.0 Å, enhanced metal ion selectivity due to the rigidity of its aromatic backbone, and its strong binding affinity particularly for Cd(II), Gd(III), and Bi(III) due to its high affinity for metal ions with an ionic radius close to 1.0 Å.",

      "question": "What challenges were encountered in determining the formation constant (log K1) for the Cd(II)/DPP complex?",
      "answer": "The challenges in determining the formation constant for the Cd(II)/DPP complex included the complex's high stability, which persisted with only a small amount of dissociation even at pH 1.0, and the ineffectiveness of competition experiments with EDTA due to the added stability provided by coordinated hydroxides preventing EDTA from displacing DPP from Cd(II).",

      "question": "How does the presence of Ca(2+) and Na(+) ions affect the fluorescence detection of Cd(II) with DPP?",
      "answer": "Ca(2+) and Na(+) ions can produce a CHEF effect with DPP, but at much higher concentrations than Cd(2+), due to their lower thermodynamic stability of complexes with DPP. Ca(2+) at 10^-3 M can interfere with Cd(2+) detection in seawater, while Na(+) at 0.1 M likely does not interfere.",

      "answer": "The role of the stereochemically active lone pair in the structure of the Pb(II)/DPP complex is to influence the geometry of coordination, resulting in shorter Pb−L bonds on the side of the Pb(II) away from the lone pair and longer Pb−O bonds to perchlorates, suggesting a hemidirected geometry.",

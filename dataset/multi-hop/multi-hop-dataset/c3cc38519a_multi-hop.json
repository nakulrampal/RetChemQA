      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the 'gate effect' observed in the CO2 sorption behavior of the MOF?",
      "answer": "The 'gate effect' explains the stepwise and hysteretic behaviors of CO2 sorption, where the framework of the MOF shrinks at lower pressure, limiting adsorption, but expands to allow more CO2 molecules to enter once the pores are filled, leading to a large hysteresis.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What synthesis method was used to obtain single crystals of the MOF?",

      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the structure of the MOF contribute to its selective gas adsorption behavior?",
      "answer": "The structure of the MOF, with its fivefold interlocked closed nanotubes and dynamic pores, contributes to its selective adsorption of CO2 over N2 and H2 by allowing CO2 molecules to interact with the framework and open the channels.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What experimental techniques were used to characterize the synthesized MOF?",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the presence of guest water molecules affect the structure of the MOF?",
      "answer": "The presence of guest water molecules fills the pores of the MOF, and their removal at around 60°C leads to a change in the framework structure, as indicated by thermogravimetric analysis and variable-temperature PXRD.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the impact of the hydroxyl group and/or the secondary amines of L on the CO2 sorption behavior of the MOF?",
      "answer": "The hydroxyl group and/or the secondary amines of L located at the surface of the pores can strongly interact with CO2 molecules, leading to the generation of large hysteresis in CO2 sorption behavior.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the effect of heating on the framework of the MOF?",
      "answer": "Heating the MOF to 50°C causes the framework to shrink after the loss of guest water molecules, as demonstrated by the shift of PXRD peaks to higher angles.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"

    },
    {
      "question": "Why was the methoxy group chosen for comparison in the study of post-synthetic modification?",
      "answer": "The methoxy group was chosen for comparison because it is similar in size and composition to the formyl tag but is unable to react with DPH, making it suitable for studying the effects of post-synthetic modification.",

      "question": "What is the role of energetic materials (EMs) and how are they classified?",
      "answer": "Energetic materials (EMs) play an important role in national defense and other aspects by undergoing a violent redox reaction when stimulated by the external environment (impact, friction, heat, light, etc.), releasing a large amount of energy (light, heat, sound, detonation wave, etc.). They are classified into primary explosives, secondary explosives, and pyrotechnics based on the form, size, rate of the released energy, and mechanical sensitivity.",

      "question": "What are the advantages of using coordination polymers (CPs) for preparing new types of primary explosives?",
      "answer": "Coordination polymers (CPs) offer several advantages for preparing new types of primary explosives: 1) Oxidative groups or explosive groups can be introduced from the molecular level by simple crystallization methods. 2) The molecular weight of the ligands is small, and the synthesis steps are simple. 3) A wide choice of ligands is available, even non-explosive ones can still yield ECPs with excellent detonation performance. 4) Different inorganic salts can be prepared to obtain primary explosives with different initiation methods.",

    {
      "question": "What are the key factors in the preparation of energetic coordination polymers (ECPs)?",
      "answer": "The key factors in the preparation of ECPs include the design and synthesis of ligands, as the physicochemical properties of ligands such as solubility, coordination sites, and acid-base property affect the preparation and performance of ECPs.",

    {
      "question": "What are the main indicators for measuring energetic materials and how were they predicted for the ECPs in the study?",
      "answer": "Detonation speed (D) and explosion pressure (P) are the main indicators for measuring energetic materials. In the study, these detonation characteristics of the ECPs were predicted using the modified Kamlet-Jacobs (K-J) equations, which are commonly used for predicting the detonation velocity and pressure of high-energy materials.",

      "question": "What experimental methods were used to evaluate the explosion performance of the synthesized ECPs?",
      "answer": "The explosion performance of the synthesized ECPs was evaluated using hot needle (HN) tests, laser performance tests, detonation initiation tests using a lead plate explosive test, and combustion cell tests.",

    {
      "question": "What was the conclusion regarding the detonation performance and sensitivity of ECPs-6 and ECPs-8 based on the study?",
      "answer": "The study concluded that ECPs-6 and ECPs-8 have shorter deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT) effects, with ECPs-8 being the shortest. Both ECPs-6 and ECPs-8 can be directly detonated by laser, but ECPs-8 has more violent laser performance. The ignition mechanism study showed that ECPs-8 produces the most free radicals, leading to its superior detonation performance and sensitivity.",

      "question": "True or False: According to the study, ECPs containing ClO4- can be directly detonated by laser due to the generation of free radicals.",

      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What theoretical studies were conducted to understand the ignition mechanism of the ECPs?",
      "answer": "Theoretical studies of the ignition mechanism of the ECPs included optimization of structures under the level of M06-2X with the basis set of def2tzvp, discussions of Wiberg bond index and Mayer bond order (MBO), and Car-Parrinello Molecular Dynamic (CPMD) methods to understand the relationship between structures and stabilities in the decomposition processes.",

    {
      "question": "What was the main conclusion of the study regarding the relationship between the physical and chemical properties of the ECPs and their detonation energy?",
      "answer": "The main conclusion of the study was the establishment of the 'DSC-MS-DP-IM' interrelationship sketch map, which explained the relationship between the decomposition form, mechanical sensitivity, and detonation energy of the ECPs, concluding that ECPs-8 has the strongest detonation performance and the most sensitivity among the synthesized ECPs.",

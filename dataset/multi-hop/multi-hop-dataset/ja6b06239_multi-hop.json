      "question": "What is the primary purpose of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) in catalytic reactions as described in the text?",
      "answer": "The primary purpose of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) in catalytic reactions is to stabilize mono(phosphine)–metal complexes, enhancing their activity in various catalytic reactions such as hydrosilylation of ketones and alkenes, hydrogenation of alkenes, and C–H borylation of arenes.",

    {
      "question": "How does the synthesis of P1-MOF·M catalysts contribute to their catalytic performance?",
      "answer": "The synthesis of P1-MOF·M catalysts, involving postsynthetic metalation of a porous triarylphosphine-based MOF with metal complexes (M = Rh and Ir), contributes to their catalytic performance by isolating catalytic sites within the MOF structure. This isolation prevents deleterious ligand exchanges and stabilizes the mono(phosphine)–metal intermediates, significantly enhancing catalytic activity.",

    {
      "question": "True or False: The MOF catalysts outperformed their homogeneous counterparts due to their ability to prevent disproportionation reactions/ligand exchanges.",

    {
      "question": "What role does the Zr-oxo SBUs and triarylphosphine-derived tricarboxylate linkers play in the structure and function of P1-MOF?",
      "answer": "The Zr-oxo SBUs (Secondary Building Units) and triarylphosphine-derived tricarboxylate linkers play a crucial role in the structure and function of P1-MOF by providing stability through Zr–carboxylate bonds and facilitating the isolation of phosphine sites. This structural arrangement is key to the selective synthesis of mono(phosphine)–metal complexes within the MOF, which are highly active in catalytic reactions.",

    {
      "question": "How does the incorporation of orthogonal ligands to MOFs affect their application as catalysts?",
      "answer": "The incorporation of orthogonal ligands to MOFs provides a highly tunable platform for designing single-site solid catalysts. This tunability allows for the precise control over the catalytic sites within the MOF structure, enhancing the selectivity and efficiency of the catalyst in various organic reactions.",

      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What evidence supports the heterogeneity of the MOF catalysts in catalytic reactions?",
      "answer": "The evidence supporting the heterogeneity of the MOF catalysts includes the maintenance of the PXRD patterns of the MOFs after catalytic reactions, low leaching of metal and Zr into the supernatant, and the cessation of catalytic activity upon removal of the MOF from the reaction mixture. These observations demonstrate that the catalysis occurs within the solid phase of the MOF, indicating its heterogeneous nature.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the BET surface area of 471 m2/g for P1-MOF?",
      "answer": "The BET surface area of 471 m2/g for P1-MOF indicates a high degree of porosity within the MOF structure. This high surface area is significant because it allows for greater exposure of the catalytic sites to reactants, potentially enhancing the catalytic efficiency and effectiveness of the MOF in various reactions.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does the use of X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAFS) contribute to understanding the catalytic mechanism of MOF catalysts?",
      "answer": "The use of X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAFS) contributes to understanding the catalytic mechanism of MOF catalysts by providing detailed information on the metal coordination environment within the MOFs. By analyzing the EXAFS spectra and fitting parameters, researchers can deduce the nature of metal-ligand interactions and changes in the coordination environment during catalysis, offering insights into the catalytic processes occurring within the MOF structure.",

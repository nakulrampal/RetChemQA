    {
      "question": "What is the primary application focus of the metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) discussed in the article?",
      "answer": "The primary application focus of the metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) discussed in the article is CO2 capture.",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the platform described in the article achieve high gas uptake capacity?",
      "answer": "The platform achieves high gas uptake capacity by accommodating a large variety of organic ligands and homo- or hetero-metallic clusters, allowing for extraordinary tunability in gas sorption properties.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the isosteric heat of adsorption being as low as 20 kJ mol-1 for carbon dioxide in the context of the article?",
      "answer": "The significance of the isosteric heat of adsorption being as low as 20 kJ mol-1 for carbon dioxide is that it could bring a distinct economic advantage due to significantly reduced energy consumption for activation and regeneration of adsorbents.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The pacs platform described in the article relies on open metal sites for high CO2 uptake.",
      "answer": "False",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does the pore-space partition (PSP) ligand play in the pacs platform according to the article?",
      "answer": "The pore-space partition (PSP) ligand plays a role in partitioning the pore space of Mg-based MOFs, which contributes to the stabilization of bonds that are otherwise less likely to form, and significantly enhances CO2 uptake properties.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The article mentions that the pacs platform exhibits a totally different mechanism for high CO2 uptake compared to other MOF platforms.",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "According to the article, what is the CO2 uptake capacity of MOF-74-Mg at 273 K and 1 bar?",
      "answer": "MOF-74-Mg has a CO2 uptake capacity slightly under 230 cm3 g-1 at 273 K and 1 bar.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the impact of the pore-space partition (PSP) over open metal sites on CO2 uptake as discussed in the article?",
      "answer": "The impact of the pore-space partition (PSP) over open metal sites on CO2 uptake is superior, as demonstrated by the comparison between CPM-230 and CPM-231, where PSP contributes much more to the extraordinarily high CO2 storage capacity compared to open metal sites.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The article suggests that the pacs platform could potentially be used for gas separation applications beyond CO2 capture.",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What does the article imply about the versatility of the pacs platform in terms of compositional diversity?",
      "answer": "The article implies that the pacs platform is highly versatile in terms of compositional diversity, as it can accommodate a large variety of crosslinking carboxylate ligands and different metal clusters, resulting in a wide range of MOFs with varied properties.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"

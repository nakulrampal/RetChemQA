    {
      "question": "Why are binuclear metallacycles considered more complex than mononuclear complexes in stereoselective noncovalent polymerization?",
      "answer": "Binuclear metallacycles are considered more complex because they contain two chiral metal centers with opposing absolute configurations, increasing the supramolecular complexity compared to mononuclear complexes.",

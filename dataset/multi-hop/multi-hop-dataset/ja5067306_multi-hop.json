      "question": "What is the relationship between the synthesis conditions of 1-Ln and 2-Ln compounds?",
      "answer": "1-Ln compounds are synthesized using lanthanide nitrate, D-camphoric acid, and acetic acid in a mixed solvent system of DMA and water, while 2-Ln compounds are synthesized under similar conditions but with formic acid and DMF, indicating that the choice of acid (acetic or formic) and solvent (DMA or DMF) influences the type of compound formed.",

      "question": "What is the significance of the observation that Ho is incapable of crystallizing in 1-Ln, but Dy can readily crystallize in 1-Ln?",
      "answer": "This observation suggests the intrinsic phase selectivity of the MOF platform, indicating that the MOF structure type is highly sensitive to the size of ionic radii, which could be leveraged for lanthanide separation.",

      "question": "How does the coordination number of Ln3+ ions differ between 1-Ln and 2-Ln compounds?",
      "answer": "In 1-Ln compounds, each Ln3+ ion has one pendant H2O, making it 8-coordinated, while in 2-Ln compounds, each Ln3+ ion, without H2O, is only 7-coordinated, indicating that the coordination number correlates with ionic radii, with smaller ions adopting a lower coordination number.",

    {
      "question": "What role do acetate and formate play in the crystallization process of 1-Ln and 2-Ln compounds?",
      "answer": "Acetate and formate serve as monodentate carboxylates that chelate to one metal while bridging to another metal in a μ2-O manner, forming an infinite chain that reinforces the connection of Ln3+ ions already linked by D-cam ligands and rendering the overall framework neutral, indicating their key role in the crystallization process.",

    {
      "question": "What does the observation that the smaller Ln3+ ion is preferred for a given MOF suggest about the binding constant between Ln3+ and camphorate/formate?",
      "answer": "This observation suggests that the smaller Ln3+ ion tends to form more stable metal complexes in the solution phase due to a stronger binding constant between smaller Ln3+ and camphorate/formate, which is consistent with the knowledge that smaller Ln3+ tends to form more stable metal complexes.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The selectivity between two M2 ions is lower compared to that between M1 and M2 due to the fact that two M2 ions are even more similar in ionic radii.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the selectivity for smaller Ln3+ ions by the 2-Ln phase in the context of MOF platforms?",
      "answer": "The selectivity for smaller Ln3+ ions by the 2-Ln phase indicates that the Ln separation principle used for solvent extraction and ion chromatography is directly transferable to selective MOF crystallization, suggesting that this preference can serve as the basis for developing MOF platforms for crystallization-based separations beyond just lanthanide mixtures.",

    {
      "question": "What does the inability to achieve cross crystallizations (i.e., Type 1 for late Ln3+ or Type 2 for early Ln3+) suggest about the MOF platform?",
      "answer": "The inability to achieve cross crystallizations suggests the intrinsic phase selectivity of the MOF platform, indicating that the MOF structure type is highly sensitive to the size of ionic radii and that this selectivity could form the basis for a new cost-effective method for Ln separation.",

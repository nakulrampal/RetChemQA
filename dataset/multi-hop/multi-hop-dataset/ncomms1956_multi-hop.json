    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the pore window size in UTSA-16 for CO2 capture?",
      "answer": "The pore window size of about 3.3×5.4 Å2 in UTSA-16 is significant for CO2 capture as it allows for a potentially high size-selective effect, which is beneficial for the selective separation of CO2 from light gases such as N2 and CH4.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the presence of coordinated water molecules in UTSA-16 contribute to its CO2 capture capabilities?",
      "answer": "The presence of coordinated water molecules within UTSA-16 contributes to its CO2 capture capabilities through hydrogen-bonding interactions with CO2 gas molecules, which enhances the selectivity and capacity for CO2 capture.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is UTSA-16 considered superior for CO2/CH4 separation at ambient conditions compared to other MOFs?",
      "answer": "UTSA-16 is considered superior for CO2/CH4 separation at ambient conditions due to its high CO2 uptake capacity, significant selectivity, and the presence of coordinated water molecules that enhance interactions with CO2, making it highly effective for selective CO2 capture.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does the diamondoid cage structure play in the performance of UTSA-16 for CO2 capture?",
      "answer": "The diamondoid cage structure in UTSA-16, with a diameter of about 4.5 Å, plays a crucial role in trapping CO2 molecules efficiently through cooperative interactions, contributing to its high density of CO2 capture and selectivity at ambient conditions.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the CO2 density within UTSA-16 compare to liquid CO2 density, and what does this imply for its CO2 capture efficiency?",
      "answer": "The CO2 density within UTSA-16 is approximately equal to the liquid CO2 density of 1.032 g cm−3, implying that UTSA-16 can trap CO2 in a highly efficient manner, reaching saturation even at 296 K and 1 atm, which highlights its potential for effective CO2 capture.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is UTSA-16 sensitive to moisture, and how does this affect its potential industrial usage for CO2 capture?",
      "answer": "UTSA-16 is not sensitive to moisture, as demonstrated by its repeatable and reversible CO2 sorption even after exposure to air. This property makes UTSA-16 suitable for potential industrial usage for CO2 capture, as it can be easily regenerated for long-term use.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"

    {
      "question": "True or False: UTSA-16 has a higher CO2/CH4 adsorption selectivity compared to Cu-(bpy-1)2.",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The CO2 storage capacities at room temperature and low pressure are dependent on the surface areas of the MOF materials.",
      "answer": "False",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: Mg-MOF-74 has a higher CO2 uptake capacity at room temperature and 1 bar compared to UTSA-16.",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The coordinated water molecules within UTSA-16 are removed at elevated temperature, resulting in a non-porous material.",
      "answer": "True",

      "question": "What durability tests were performed on the NU-1012/CT composites, and what were the outcomes?",
      "answer": "Durability tests on the NU-1012/CT composites involved immersing them in physiological saline or aging them under simulated sunlight for 5 days. The composites still showed a 7-log reduction against E. coli and S. epidermidis after 60 minutes of irradiation, indicating excellent durability.",

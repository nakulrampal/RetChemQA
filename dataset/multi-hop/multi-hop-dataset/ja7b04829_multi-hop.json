      "question": "What is the role of 4,4'-dipyridyl disulfide (DPDS) in the synthesis of MOF nanosheets?",
      "answer": "DPDS acts as a chemically labile intercalating agent that is incorporated into layered MOF crystals to form new intercalated MOFs. Its disulfide bond is selectively cleaved to induce exfoliation, leading to the formation of ultrathin MOF nanosheets.",

    },
    {
      "question": "Can the process of exfoliation of MOF crystals into nanosheets be controlled?",

    {
      "question": "What is the effect of the chemical reduction of DPDS on the MOF structure?",

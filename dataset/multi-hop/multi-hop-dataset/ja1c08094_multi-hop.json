      "question": "What is the significance of the dihedral angle φ in the twisting of metal–peptide chains?",
      "answer": "The dihedral angle φ indicates the twisting of the metal–peptide chains around the toroidal axis, which affects the overall shape and structure of the entangled molecular frameworks.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the substitution of the side chain from H to n-Bu affect the energy of the torus frameworks?",
      "answer": "The substitution of the side chain from H to n-Bu increases the total energy of the torus frameworks, indicating that larger side chains introduce more strain into the structure.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does the coordination angle θ play in the structure of metal–peptide frameworks?",
      "answer": "The coordination angle θ, which is the angle of the N–Ag–N bond, influences the spatial arrangement of the peptide strands and metal ions, contributing to the stability and geometry of the metal–peptide frameworks.",

    {
      "question": "Is the formation of a 91 knot more energetically favorable with a glycine (1a) or an n-butyl (1e) side chain?",
      "answer": "The formation of a 91 knot is more energetically favorable with a glycine (1a) side chain compared to an n-butyl (1e) side chain, as indicated by the lower total energy and energy per unit for the glycine-substituted framework.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"

    {
      "question": "What experimental technique was used to measure the mobility of the metal–peptide complexes in solution?",
      "answer": "Ion Mobility Mass Spectrometry (IM-MS) was used to measure the mobility of the metal–peptide complexes in solution.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the presence of different counter anions affect the NMR spectra of the metal–peptide complexation mixture?",
      "answer": "The presence of different counter anions can affect the chemical shifts and signal intensities in the NMR spectra of the metal–peptide complexation mixture, indicating changes in the electronic environment and interactions within the complexes.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The formation of toroidal supercoils is accompanied by a significant change in the dihedral angles of the peptide strands.",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the effect of increasing the concentration of the peptide ligand on the formation of torus knots and links?",
      "answer": "Increasing the concentration of the peptide ligand leads to a higher fraction of larger torus knots and links being formed, as indicated by the relative integral ratios of self-assembled products.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The formation of discrete torus complexes in solution triggers their ring opening and twisting to form toroidal supercoil oligomers upon crystallization.",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"

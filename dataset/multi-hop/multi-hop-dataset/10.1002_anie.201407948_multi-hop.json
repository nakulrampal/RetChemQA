      "question": "Based on the paper, what is the relationship between the rate of sulfinate consumption and the cell current under electrochemical conditions?",

      "question": "How does the paper rationalize the increased yield observed under electrochemical conditions?",
      "answer": "The increased yield under electrochemical conditions is rationalized by controlled radical formation, which mediates radical introduction into the system and increases the window of time for the productive reaction.",

    {
      "question": "Why were imidazoles chosen as a substrate for detailed investigation under electrochemical conditions?",

      "question": "What does the paper suggest about the role of temperature in the electrochemical initiation of C-H functionalization?",

    {
      "question": "How does the paper explain the lack of significant increase in yield when TBHP is added slowly compared to standard protocol?",
      "answer": "The lack of significant increase in yield suggests further differences between the two protocols, possibly in the second oxidation process, which may also cause slight differences in regioselectivity.",

      "question": "What does the invariant rate of sulfinate oxidation with substrate imply about the reported yields?",

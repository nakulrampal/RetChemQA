    {
      "question": "What is the significance of solvent molecules in the formation of Cage-5?",

      "question": "Why are TBA+ and DMV2+ cations found outside the cavity in Cage-3 and Cage-5?",
      "answer": "TBA+ and DMV2+ cations are found outside the cavity in Cage-3 and Cage-5 due to their relatively large size, which prevents them from being retained within the cage dimers, leading to a different location for the counter cations within the crystal structure compared to cages containing smaller cations.",

      "question": "What are the synthesis conditions for SolCON-A and SolCON-B?",
      "answer": "SolCON-A was formed by reacting complex 1 (CH2Cl2/MeOH, 1:1 v/v) with Cu(NO3)2路3H2O in ACN in a molar ratio of 1:2 using CH2Cl2/MeOH/ACN (0.5:0.5:1 v/v/v) as a cosolvent. SolCON-B was obtained using ACN as the solvent for complex 1 and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) as the solvent for Cu(NO3)2路3H2O, with ACN/DMF (1:1 v/v) as a cosolvent.",
      "difficulty": "Medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the synthesis method affect the properties of SolCON-A and SolCON-B?",
      "answer": "The synthesis method, particularly the choice of solvents and cosolvents, affects the crystallographic structures and morphologies of SolCON-A and SolCON-B. Although they have the same crystallographic structures, the dimensions of the crystals vary due to the different solvent combinations used.",
      "difficulty": "Hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the formation of SurCON dependent on the initial deposition of metal salt on the metal-oxide surface?",
      "answer": "True. The formation of SurCON requires the initial deposition of the metal salt (Cu(NO3)2路3H2O) on the metal-oxide surface (FTO), as spin coating the complex 1 first did not afford a stable film.",
      "difficulty": "Medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does the cosolvent play in the synthesis of SolCON-A and SolCON-B?",
      "answer": "The cosolvent facilitates the diffusion of solutions and influences the crystal morphology and dimensions of SolCON-A and SolCON-B, although it does not affect the overall crystallographic structure.",
      "difficulty": "Medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How were the electrochromic properties of SurCON characterized?",
      "answer": "The electrochromic properties of SurCON were characterized using UV/Vis spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and electrochemical measurements including cyclic voltammetry and spectroelectrochemical (SEC) performance analysis.",
      "difficulty": "Hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the observed Cu/Fe ratio in the characterization of SurCON?",
      "answer": "The observed Cu/Fe ratio in the characterization of SurCON indicates the formation of a fully formed network where copper centers are bound by two pyridine groups, reflecting the stoichiometry and composition of the electrochromic film.",
      "difficulty": "Medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can the metal cation exchange process be prevented in the synthesis of coordination networks?",
      "answer": "True. The metal cation exchange process can be prevented by choosing appropriate synthesis methods, such as on-surface polymerization, which allows for the retention of the structure and properties of the initial complexes.",
      "difficulty": "Medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What experimental techniques were used to analyze the morphology and composition of SolCONs?",
      "answer": "Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), including SEM-energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to analyze the morphology and composition of SolCONs.",
      "difficulty": "Medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the choice of metal salt affect the formation of coordination networks?",
      "answer": "The choice of metal salt, such as copper nitrate versus palladium chloride, affects the formation of coordination networks by influencing the metal-ligand exchange process and the resulting network structure, as demonstrated by the different outcomes when using Cu(NO3)2路3H2O and PdCl2(PhCN)2.",
      "difficulty": "Hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the stability of coordination networks influenced by the synthesis conditions?",
      "answer": "True. The stability of coordination networks, including their resistance to metal cation exchange and retention of structural features, is significantly influenced by the synthesis conditions such as solvent choice, reaction method (in solution vs. on surface), and the speed of mixing.",
      "difficulty": "Medium",
      "type": "True or False"

    {
      "question": "What is the primary adsorption site for D2 in the dense phase of ZIF-7?",
      "answer": "The primary adsorption site for D2 in the dense phase of ZIF-7 is sandwiched between the imidazolate ring of one ligand and the benzene ring of an adjacent ligand in 6-membered ring 3.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the structure of ZIF-7 change upon activation compared to its water-solvated phase?",
      "answer": "Upon activation, the structure of ZIF-7 transitions to a lower density phase with distorted {ZnN4} tetrahedra, ligand torsion, and fan-like motion of the benzimidazolate linkers, resulting in a decrease in volume and an increase in density compared to the water-solvated phase.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role do the benzene rings of the benzimidazolate ligands play in the stabilization of the dense activated phase of ZIF-7?",
      "answer": "The benzene rings of the benzimidazolate ligands play a key role in stabilizing the dense activated phase of ZIF-7 by forming face-to-face and edge-to-face pi-pi interactions, which are absent in the high symmetry system.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does pelletization affect the gas adsorption properties of ZIF-7?",
      "answer": "Pelletization of ZIF-7 with polyvinylpyrrolidone binder under varying external pressures results in minimal reduction of the gas adsorption properties, indicating that ZIF-7's gas storage properties are robust to pelletization.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the observed step-shaped hydrogen adsorption-desorption in ZIF-7?",
      "answer": "The step-shaped hydrogen adsorption-desorption in ZIF-7 indicates a pressure-induced phase change to a phase with more accessible porosity during adsorption and less accessible porosity during desorption, suggesting potential for enhanced usable capacities with minimal energetic input for hydrogen storage applications.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The structure of activated ZIF-7 is identical to its water-solvated phase.",
      "answer": "False",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What synthetic modification is hypothesized to fine-tune the phase change pressure-temperature conditions in ZIF-7?",
      "answer": "Synthetic modification along the benzene ring in the benzimidazolate linkers is hypothesized to fine-tune the phase change pressure-temperature conditions in ZIF-7 by affecting ligand-ligand interactions and adsorption strength.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The application of external pressure during pelletization does not affect the structure of ZIF-7.",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What mechanism is proposed for the hydrogen-induced phase change in ZIF-7?",
      "answer": "The hydrogen-induced phase change in ZIF-7 is proposed to occur through a combination of ligand motion, including fan-like motion and torsion, enabled by distortions of the ZIF-7 skeleton, allowing the framework to adapt its structure to optimize adsorption sites.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The adsorption sites in ZIF-7 preferentially form between two electron-rich arene rings.",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"

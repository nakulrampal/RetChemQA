      "question": "What is the primary purpose of synthesizing NU-601 in the described study?",
      "answer": "The primary purpose of synthesizing NU-601 is to create a metal–organic framework (MOF) that acts as an effective and size-selective hydrogen-bond-donor catalyst for Friedel–Crafts reactions.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the structure of NU-601 contribute to its catalytic activity?",
      "answer": "The structure of NU-601, with its large channels and N–H urea bonds projecting into the pores, contributes to its catalytic activity by providing spatial isolation of catalytic sites, which prevents self-quenching and allows for size-selective catalysis.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The synthesis of NU-601 involves the use of a symmetrical urea tetracarboxylate strut, 4,4′-bipyridine, and Zn(NO3)2·6H2O under solvothermal conditions.",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What method was used to confirm the removal of DMF from NU-601 and its replacement with MeNO2?",
      "answer": "1H NMR spectroscopic analysis was used to confirm that DMF had been more than 95% replaced with MeNO2 in NU-601.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is NU-601 considered a size-selective catalyst based on the study's findings?",
      "answer": "NU-601 is considered a size-selective catalyst because it exhibits higher rates of reaction for small substrates compared to larger ones, suggesting that catalysis primarily occurs within the pores of the material, which selectively accommodate smaller molecules.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The catalytic activity of NU-601 was tested using a Friedel–Crafts reaction between pyrroles and nitroalkenes.",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What was the role of solvent exchange in the preparation of NU-601 for catalysis?",
      "answer": "The role of solvent exchange, specifically replacing DMF with MeNO2, was crucial in opening the N–H urea sites of NU-601, rendering it catalytically active by removing residual hydrogen-bonded DMF.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the presence of large channels in NU-601's structure affect its catalytic properties?",
      "answer": "The presence of large channels in NU-601's structure affects its catalytic properties by enabling size selectivity, allowing smaller substrates to access the catalytic sites within the pores more easily than larger substrates.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: NU-601 was shown to be more active as a catalyst than diphenylurea for the Friedel–Crafts reaction.",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What evidence supports the hypothesis that catalysis by NU-601 occurs primarily within its pores?",
      "answer": "Evidence supporting the hypothesis includes the higher rates of reaction for small substrates compared to larger ones with NU-601, and the decreased substrate consumption and reaction yield when using larger substrates, indicating reagent size selectivity and internal pore catalysis.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"

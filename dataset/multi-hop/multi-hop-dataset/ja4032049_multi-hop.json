      "question": "How does the crystal structure of [Cu(bcppm)H2O]-pdes change after partial desolvation under ambient conditions?",
      "answer": "After partial desolvation, the crystal structure of [Cu(bcppm)H2O]-pdes shows a notable contraction along the c-axis, elongation along the b-axis, while the a-axis remains relatively unchanged. There are also subtle changes in the intra-layer hydrogen bonding interactions.",

      "question": "What is the significance of the SQUEEZE routine applied to the crystallographic data of [Cu(bcppm)H2O]-pdes?",
      "answer": "The SQUEEZE routine was applied to account for large solvent accessible voids and diffuse electron density peaks that could not be adequately identified as solvent. It resulted in significant reductions in R1 and wR2 and an improvement in the goodness-of-fit (GOF).",

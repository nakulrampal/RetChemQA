      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What challenges were encountered in solving the x-ray crystal structure of the compound involving H2TpyP, Pb(NO3)2, and C60?",

      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What limitations do porphyrin framework structures face as 'zeolite-like materials' according to Sun et al.?",
      "answer": "A major limitation is their fragility toward loss of occluded solvent, which leads to irreversible collapse upon total removal of solvent molecules.",

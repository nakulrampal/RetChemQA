      "question": "What is the effect of ligand functionalization on the thermal stability of Zr and Hf MOFs?",
      "answer": "Ligand functionalization does not dramatically affect the overall thermal stability of the MOFs, with decomposition of all materials occurring between ~450-500 Â°C.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the presence of Zr6 or Hf6 clusters affect the structural differences in MOFs?",
      "answer": "The presence of either Zr6 or Hf6 clusters does not appear to impart significant structural differences, as the thermal stabilities of the Zr and Hf MOFs are similar.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"

    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the contact angle measurement in determining the hydrophobicity of MOF surfaces?",
      "answer": "Measurement of the contact angle of water on a MOF surface demonstrates a comparative degree of hydrophobicity of the MOF substrate, explaining the wetting behavior of particular liquid/solid pairs.",

    {
      "question": "How does the incorporation of fluorine atoms in the ligand structure affect the hydrophobicity of Zr-L5?",
      "answer": "Substitution of only one third of the ligand protons for fluorine atoms results in Zr-L5 being superhydrophobic, demonstrating that subtle changes to the organic ligand can dramatically alter the MOFs' hydrophobicities.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the observed effect of water on the fluorescence emission of L7-H2 compared to other ligands?",
      "answer": "Significant changes were observed between dried and wetted samples of L7-H2, suggesting potential sensor applications due to the presence of benzothiadiazolyl units that are well-known fluorescent probes.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does Zr-L5 not show a response to wetting in its photoluminescence spectrum?",
      "answer": "Zr-L5 shows no response to wetting due to its hydrophobicity, preventing water from penetrating into and interacting with the framework.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What causes the structural perturbation observed in Zr-L2 upon thermal treatment?",
      "answer": "The structural perturbation observed in Zr-L2 upon thermal treatment is attributed to twisting of the ligands upon heating, reorienting the linkers to planarity and full conjugation.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the presence of naphthyl and benzothiadiazolyl fluorophores in Zr-L6 and Zr-L7 affect CO2 uptake?",
      "answer": "The presence of naphthyl and benzothiadiazolyl fluorophores in Zr-L6 and Zr-L7 enhances CO2 uptake despite the reduction in N2 uptake, suggesting favorable interactions between CO2 molecules and the functionalized ligands.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the fluorescence property of Zr MOFs inherited from their ligands?",
      "answer": "Yes, the fluorescence properties of each Zr MOF are inherited from the ligand, as demonstrated by the similarity of the solid-state emission profiles of the dimethyl esters and the Zr MOFs.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "Does the solvatochromism behavior of Zr-L2 and Zr-L7 indicate a requirement for the framework topology for their solvent-dependent emission behavior?",
      "answer": "Yes, the solvatochromism behavior of Zr-L2 and Zr-L7 indicates a requirement for the framework topology for their solvent-dependent emission behavior, as the corresponding dimethyl esters show no distinctive solvent-dependent emission shifts in the solid-state.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"

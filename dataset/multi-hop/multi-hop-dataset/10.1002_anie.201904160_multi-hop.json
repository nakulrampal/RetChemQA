    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of open metal sites in the binding affinity of JNU-1 towards acetylene?",
      "answer": "Open metal sites contribute more to the binding affinity because of the ability of acetylene to coordinate to the metal center.",

      "question": "How does the framework of JNU-1 adapt upon acetylene adsorption according to in situ PXRD patterns?",
      "answer": "The framework of JNU-1 self-adapts in response to the increasing loading of acetylene, showing a continuous shift of peaks to higher angles.",

    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the increasing adsorption enthalpy (Qst) value with C2H2 loading in JNU-1?",
      "answer": "It implies a progressively stronger host–guest interaction, which is rare and indicates an exceptional C2H2 binding affinity.",

    },
    {
      "question": "Why is JNU-1 considered superior in binding affinity towards acetylene compared to other MOFs with open ZnII sites?",
      "answer": "Because the maximum Qst for JNU-1 is the highest among all reported MOFs with open ZnII sites, indicating a superior binding affinity.",

    {
      "question": "What does the continuous decrease in adsorption capacity upon repeated C2H2 adsorption measurements suggest about JNU-1?",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the induced-fit behavior of JNU-1 contribute to its gas separation performance?",
      "answer": "The induced-fit behavior enhances the host–guest and guest–guest interactions, leading to an unprecedented increase in adsorption enthalpy and selectivity for C2H2 over CO2.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of cooperative action of two open ZnII centers in JNU-1's mechanism for C2H2 binding?",
      "answer": "Two coordinatively unsaturated ZnII centers attract one C2H2 molecule and place it on site I through cooperative action, enhancing the binding affinity.",

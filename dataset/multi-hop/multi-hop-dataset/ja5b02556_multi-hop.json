      "question": "How does the Xe/Kr selectivity of SBMOF-2 compare to NiMOF-74 according to the IAST calculation?",
      "answer": "The Xe/Kr adsorption selectivity of SBMOF-2 is about 10, which is comparable to the value for NiMOF-74.",

      "question": "Is the productivity of pure Kr in SBMOF-2 higher than in Co formate when separating a 20/80 Xe/Kr mixture at 298 K?",
      "answer": "False. The productivity of SBMOF-2 is slightly below that of Co formate.",

      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the main reason for the Xe selectivity over Kr in SBMOF-2?",
      "answer": "The Xe selectivity may be attributed to the specific geometry of the pores, forming cages built with phenyl rings and enriched with polar −OH groups, both of which serve as strong adsorption sites for polarizable Xe gas.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Does SBMOF-2 maintain its structure after dehydration according to XRD experiments?",
      "answer": "True. SBMOF-2 retains its structure after dehydration, with a small change of ∼3% in the unit cell volume.",

      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of −OH groups in the adsorption mechanism of SBMOF-2?",
      "answer": "The −OH groups found exclusively in channels of type-II serve as more polarizing parts in the network, resulting in significantly higher occupancy of the adsorbed noble gases.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What experimental method was used to determine the isosteric heat of adsorption for Xe and Kr in SBMOF-2?",
      "answer": "The isosteric heat of adsorption was determined using the Clausius–Clapeyron equation based on the dual-Langmuir–Freundlich model fitting of the gas isotherms.",

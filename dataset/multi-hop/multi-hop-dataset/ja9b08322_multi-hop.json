      "question": "What are the key factors that influence the adsorption selectivity of benzene over cyclohexane in metal-organic frameworks?",
      "answer": "The key factors influencing the adsorption selectivity of benzene over cyclohexane in metal-organic frameworks include the pore size and functionality of the MOF, the presence of open metal sites, and the π-electron interactions between the aromatic ring of benzene and the framework.",

    {
      "question": "How does the presence of open metal sites in a metal-organic framework affect its gas adsorption properties?",
      "answer": "The presence of open metal sites in a metal-organic framework enhances its gas adsorption properties by providing specific sites for gas molecules to bind, increasing the interaction strength and selectivity for certain gases over others.",

    {
      "question": "Why do metal-organic frameworks with π-electron rich pore surfaces show high selectivity for benzene adsorption?",
      "answer": "Metal-organic frameworks with π-electron rich pore surfaces show high selectivity for benzene adsorption due to π-π interactions between the aromatic rings of benzene and the π-electron rich surfaces, which favor the adsorption of benzene over less π-electron rich molecules like cyclohexane.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does the pore size of a metal-organic framework play in determining its gas adsorption selectivity?",
      "answer": "The pore size of a metal-organic framework plays a crucial role in determining its gas adsorption selectivity by dictating which gas molecules can enter and be adsorbed within the pores. Smaller pores may selectively adsorb smaller gas molecules, while larger pores can accommodate larger molecules, influencing the overall selectivity.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How can the functionalization of metal-organic frameworks be used to enhance their gas adsorption selectivity?",
      "answer": "The functionalization of metal-organic frameworks can enhance their gas adsorption selectivity by introducing specific functional groups that interact with certain gas molecules more strongly than others. This can include groups that form hydrogen bonds, π-π interactions, or coordinate to open metal sites, thereby increasing selectivity for targeted gases.",

    {
      "question": "Is the maximum adsorption capacity of a metal-organic framework always indicative of its performance in real-world applications for gas adsorption?",
      "answer": "No, the maximum adsorption capacity of a metal-organic framework is not always indicative of its performance in real-world applications for gas adsorption. Factors such as selectivity, stability under operating conditions, and regeneration ability are also important for practical applications.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does the stability of a metal-organic framework under operating conditions affect its suitability for gas adsorption applications?",
      "answer": "The stability of a metal-organic framework under operating conditions affects its suitability for gas adsorption applications by determining its longevity, performance consistency, and ability to be regenerated and reused. Frameworks that degrade or lose adsorption capacity under operating conditions may not be suitable for long-term or repeated use.",
      "difficulty": "medium",

    {
      "question": "Can metal-organic frameworks be engineered to selectively adsorb CO2 over N2, and what factors contribute to this selectivity?",
      "answer": "Yes, metal-organic frameworks can be engineered to selectively adsorb CO2 over N2. Factors contributing to this selectivity include the presence of open metal sites for CO2 coordination, pore size and shape that preferentially accommodate CO2 molecules, and functional groups that interact more strongly with CO2.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What strategies can be employed to enhance the reusability of metal-organic frameworks for gas adsorption applications?",
      "answer": "Strategies to enhance the reusability of metal-organic frameworks for gas adsorption applications include designing frameworks with high chemical and thermal stability, developing efficient regeneration methods that do not degrade the framework structure, and incorporating functional groups that can be easily cleaned or regenerated.",

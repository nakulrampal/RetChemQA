    },
    {
      "question": "Based on the data, what can be inferred about the structural stability of the molecule with respect to temperature changes?",
      "answer": "The data suggests that the molecule undergoes structural changes with temperature, as indicated by varying X1····O3 and O3-O4 distances, implying that the structure may become more expanded or rearranged at higher temperatures.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is there any temperature at which the X1····O3 distance increases instead of decreasing?",
      "answer": "Yes, at 323K, the X1····O3 distance slightly increases compared to its value at 313K before decreasing again at higher temperatures.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What could be the possible reason for the increase in O3-O4 distance with temperature?",
      "answer": "The increase in O3-O4 distance with temperature could be due to thermal expansion or increased molecular vibrations leading to a more expanded or less compact molecular structure.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "At what temperature does the O3-O4 distance show the highest value according to the data?",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What does the change in distances X1····O3 and O3-O4 with temperature suggest about the molecular interactions within the structure?",
      "answer": "The changes in X1····O3 and O3-O4 distances with temperature suggest that molecular interactions within the structure are temperature-dependent, possibly indicating weaker interactions or increased flexibility at higher temperatures.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Based on the provided data, how does temperature affect the molecular geometry of the compound?",
      "answer": "Temperature affects the molecular geometry of the compound by altering distances between specific atoms (X1····O3 and O3-O4), indicating that the compound's molecular geometry becomes more expanded or rearranged as temperature increases.",

    {
      "question": "What are the key features of the lanthanide MOFs discussed in the research?",
      "answer": "The lanthanide MOFs discussed in the research are highly pH-stable, have tunable luminescence, and can serve as a ratiometric luminescent probe for sulfamethazine.",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How were the lanthanide MOFs synthesized according to the experimental section?",
      "answer": "The lanthanide MOFs were synthesized by heating a mixture of LnCl3·6H2O, H4L, H2C2O4·2H2O, and H2O in a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave at 100 °C for 96 hours, then cooled to room temperature to collect the crystals.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What method was used to calculate the LOD (Limit of Detection) for sulfamethazine using the lanthanide MOFs?",
      "answer": "The LOD for sulfamethazine was calculated using the equation LOD = 3SD/|S|, where SD is the standard deviation of replicate detection of blank solutions, F is the relative luminescent intensities, F0 is the average of F, and S is the slope of the linear relationship.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The PXRD patterns of the lanthanide MOFs remained unchanged after being soaked in boiling water for 10 hours, indicating their high water stability.",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What was the role of the H4L ligand in the luminescence properties of the lanthanide MOFs?",
      "answer": "The H4L ligand served as an 'antenna' or sensitizer, effectively transferring absorbed energy to Ln3+ ions through 'antenna effects' and enhancing the luminescence of the Ln-MOFs.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the luminescence quenching mechanism of sulfamethazine work with the lanthanide MOFs?",
      "answer": "The luminescence quenching mechanism of sulfamethazine with the lanthanide MOFs is due to the cooperative result of static quenching and the internal filtration effect (IFE) between the MOFs and sulfamethazine.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The luminescence lifetime of the lanthanide MOFs significantly changed after adding sulfamethazine, indicating a dynamic quenching process.",
      "answer": "False",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What was the significance of the PXRD patterns and IR spectra of the lanthanide MOFs treated with sulfamethazine?",
      "answer": "The consistency of the PXRD patterns and IR spectra of the lanthanide MOFs treated with sulfamethazine with the initial ones indicated that the quenching phenomenon was not due to the collapse of the structural integrity.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How were the real samples of urine and mariculture water tested for sulfamethazine using the lanthanide MOFs?",
      "answer": "The real samples of urine and mariculture water were tested for sulfamethazine using the lanthanide MOFs by employing the standard addition method to determine the recovery rate, which showed satisfactory accuracy and reliability.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The lanthanide MOFs can be used for making invisible anti-counterfeiting labels and writing confidential information due to their distinctive optical properties.",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"

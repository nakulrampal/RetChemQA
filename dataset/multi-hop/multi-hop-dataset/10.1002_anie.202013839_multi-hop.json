      "question": "What are the two types of polycarboxylate RhII-MOPs synthesized in the study, and how are they different in terms of carboxylic acid group placement?",
      "answer": "The two types of polycarboxylate RhII-MOPs synthesized are cuboctahedral MOP functionalized with twelve carboxylic acid groups and cuboctahedral MOP functionalized with 24 carboxylic acid groups. The first is functionalized at the vertices through a coordinative route, while the second is functionalized at the edges through a covalent route.",

      "question": "What is the role of small-scale mantle convection in the segmentation of mid-ocean ridges with an axial valley?",
      "answer": "Small-scale mantle convection below the ridge favors an asymmetrical breaking of the axial-valley lithosphere, leading to the development and separation of ridge segments in a pattern that mimics the observed geometry and temporal evolution of the segmentation of most ridges with an axial valley.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does the inclusion of diverging plates' shear in the model affect the orientation of convective rolls?",

    {
      "question": "What is the impact of the asymmetric stress field produced by the convective pattern on the mid-ocean ridge?",

      "question": "What demonstrates that the [Ag(TEB)CF3S03]'(C6H6h crystals are indeed porous to benzene exchange?",
      "answer": "The demonstration that the [Ag(TEB)CF3S03]'(C6H6h crystals are indeed porous to benzene exchange is shown by the fact that after washing with C6D6 and dissolving in fully deuterated acetone, NMR spectroscopy showed no peak for the original benzene, indicating the absence of the original benzene and thus confirming the exchange.",

      "question": "What is the significance of the asymmetric convective pattern in the development of mid-ocean ridge segmentation?",
      "answer": "The significance of the asymmetric convective pattern in the development of mid-ocean ridge segmentation is that it produces an asymmetric stress field in the lithosphere, which is capable of splitting a straight ridge axis into segments, thereby influencing the geometry and temporal evolution of ridge segmentation.",

      "answer": "The trifiate ions are weakly coordinated to the silver in the layer at the axial position of a trigonal pyramid at a distance of 2.390 A, and consequently occupy the cavity space in an adjacent layer, indicating that the [Ag(TCB)(CF3S03)] crystal does not have an open channel structure.",

      "question": "How does the crystal structure of [Ag(TEB)CF3S03] differ from the LaPtSi structure in terms of void spaces?",
      "answer": "The crystal structure of [Ag(TEB)CF3S03] is homeotypic with the LaPtSi structure, but due to the significantly larger size of the tritopic ligand compared to the Ag(1) or the CF3S03- ions, a single LaPtSi type net constructed with the dimensions of the tritopic ligand and Ag(1) generates large void spaces, which are not fully occupied by the trifiate anion.",

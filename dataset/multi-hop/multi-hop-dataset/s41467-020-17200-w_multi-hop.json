      "question": "How does the presence of -NH2 groups affect the emission properties of Ag12bpy-NH2 compared to Ag12bpy?",
      "answer": "The presence of -NH2 groups in Ag12bpy-NH2 leads to a blue fluorescence component in addition to a yellow phosphorescence component, prolongs the lifetime of the phosphorescence component by ~15,000-fold, and increases the quantum yield from 12.1 to 14.6% under vacuum.",

      "question": "How does the introduction of -NH2 groups and the change in synthesis method impact the structure and properties of Ag12bpy-NH2?",
      "answer": "The introduction of -NH2 groups and the change in synthesis method result in a new isostructural complex, Ag12bpy-NH2, with enhanced luminescent properties, including a significant increase in the phosphorescence lifetime and quantum yield.",

      "question": "What is the significance of the 100-nm gap in wavelength and 8,500,000-fold difference in lifetime between the fluorescence and phosphorescence components of Ag12bpy-NH2?",
      "answer": "The 100-nm gap in wavelength and 8,500,000-fold difference in lifetime between the fluorescence and phosphorescence components of Ag12bpy-NH2 enable it to function as a single-component Fl-Ph ratiometric sensor for molecular oxygen, achieving ultrafast responses towards trace oxygen gas.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does the modification of the MOF linker in Ag12bpy-NH2 modulate the phosphorescence properties?",
      "answer": "The modification of the MOF linker in Ag12bpy-NH2 with amino groups triggers spin-orbit coupling and increases the rate of intersystem crossing, thus prolonging the lifetime of the phosphorescence component and enhancing its sensitivity to oxygen.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: Ag12bpy-NH2 exhibits a longer phosphorescence lifetime under vacuum compared to Ag12bpy.",

      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What potential applications are suggested for metal cluster-based MOFs like Ag12bpy-NH2 due to their luminescent sensing capabilities?",
      "answer": "Metal cluster-based MOFs like Ag12bpy-NH2 have great potential in luminescent sensing, solar energy transformation, and photocatalysis due to their longer-lived charge-separated states and enhanced luminescent properties.",

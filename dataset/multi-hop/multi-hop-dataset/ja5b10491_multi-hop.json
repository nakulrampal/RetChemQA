      "question": "What is the primary focus of the research article with DOI 10.1021/jacs.5b10491?",
      "answer": "The primary focus of the research article is on the synthesis of a new flexible porous coordination polymer (PCP) [Mn­(bdc)­(dpe)] and its selective adsorption of CO2 over C2H2 due to an adsorbate discriminatory gate effect.",

    {
      "question": "What unique property does the porous coordination polymer [Mn­(bdc)­(dpe)] exhibit in the presence of CO2 and C2H2 gases?",
      "answer": "The porous coordination polymer [Mn­(bdc)­(dpe)] exhibits an adsorbate discriminatory gate effect, showing gate opening type abrupt adsorption for C2H2 but not for CO2, leading to selective adsorption of CO2 over C2H2 at near ambient temperature.",

    {
      "question": "How does the orientation of phenylene rings in the nanopores of [Mn­(bdc)­(dpe)] affect the selective adsorption of CO2 over C2H2?",
      "answer": "The orientation of phenylene rings in the nanopores of [Mn­(bdc)­(dpe)] affects selective adsorption by causing different interactions with CO2 and C2H2. CO2 interacts smoothly due to its quadrupole moment, while C2H2 requires a structural transformation for adsorption due to its opposite quadrupole moment, leading to selective adsorption of CO2.",

      "question": "What experimental techniques were used to verify the mechanism of selective adsorption in [Mn­(bdc)­(dpe)]?",
      "answer": "In situ adsorption-X-ray diffraction experiments and density functional theory calculations were used to verify the mechanism of selective adsorption in [Mn­(bdc)­(dpe)], demonstrating different orientations and interactions of CO2 and C2H2 within the nanopores.",

      "question": "True or False: The porous coordination polymer [Mn­(bdc)­(dpe)] shows higher adsorption for C2H2 compared to CO2 at near ambient temperature.",

    {
      "question": "What role does the structural flexibility of [Mn­(bdc)­(dpe)] play in its gas adsorption properties?",
      "answer": "The structural flexibility of [Mn­(bdc)­(dpe)] plays a crucial role in its gas adsorption properties by allowing the framework to undergo transformations in response to the presence of specific gas molecules, enabling selective adsorption through the gate opening mechanism.",

      "question": "True or False: The adsorption behavior of CO2 and C2H2 in [Mn­(bdc)­(dpe)] remains unchanged after [2 + 2] photodimerization of the dpe ligands.",
      "answer": "False",

    {
      "question": "How does the [2 + 2] photodimerization of dpe ligands in [Mn­(bdc)­(dpe)] affect its CO2/C2H2 selectivity?",
      "answer": "The [2 + 2] photodimerization of dpe ligands in [Mn­(bdc)­(dpe)] affects its CO2/C2H2 selectivity by altering the orientation of phenylene rings and the pore structure, which leads to the loss of efficient interaction between CO2 and the pore surface, thereby removing the inverse selectivity for CO2 over C2H2.",

    {
      "question": "True or False: The gate opening pressure for C2H2 adsorption in [Mn­(bdc)­(dpe)] decreases with increasing temperature.",

      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the gate opening pressure in the adsorption process of [Mn­(bdc)­(dpe)]?",
      "answer": "The gate opening pressure is significant in the adsorption process of [Mn­(bdc)­(dpe)] as it determines the pressure at which an abrupt increase in adsorption occurs for a specific gas molecule, indicating a structural transformation of the framework and enabling selective adsorption.",

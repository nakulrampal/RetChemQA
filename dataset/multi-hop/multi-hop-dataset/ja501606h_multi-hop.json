      "question": "What are the synthesis conditions for MOF-519 and MOF-520?",
      "answer": "MOF-519 was synthesized by heating a mixture of aluminum nitrate, H3BTB, nitric acid, and DMF at 150 °C for 4 days. MOF-520 was synthesized under different conditions, replacing nitric acid with formic acid.",

      "question": "What is the effect of replacing nitric acid with formic acid in the synthesis of MOF-520 compared to MOF-519?",
      "answer": "Replacing nitric acid with formic acid in the synthesis of MOF-520 results in a MOF with larger void space and higher methane storage capacity compared to MOF-519.",

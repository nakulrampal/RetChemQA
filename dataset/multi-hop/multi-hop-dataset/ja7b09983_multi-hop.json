      "question": "What was the method used for solid-state circular dichroism (CD) measurements?",
      "answer": "The method used for solid-state circular dichroism (CD) measurements involved either mixing the sample with KBr to form a tablet for transmission measurements or grinding the sample into a fine powder for diffuse reflectance measurements, followed by recording the CD spectra using a J-1500 CD spectrometer.",

      "question": "What were the challenges in synthesizing large enantiopure Zn2(dobpdc) single crystals using D-panthenol?",
      "answer": "The challenges in synthesizing large enantiopure Zn2(dobpdc) single crystals using D-panthenol included the formation of only colorless, needle-shaped crystals suitable for single-crystal X-ray diffraction at lower equivalents of D-panthenol, while higher equivalents resulted in polycrystalline powder instead of large single crystals.",

      "question": "What are the two mixed-linker Zr-MOFs synthesized in the study, and what unique structures do they possess?",
      "answer": "The two mixed-linker Zr-MOFs synthesized in the study are PCN-133 and PCN-134. Both possess a layer-pillar structure, where the connection between Zr6 clusters and primary BTB linkers form a (3,6)-connected kdg layer that is further extended into 3D frameworks by auxiliary DCDPS/TCPP linkers.",

      "question": "How does the defect density in PCN-134 affect its properties, and what specific property is tuned by adjusting the BTB/TCPP ratios?",
      "answer": "The defect density in PCN-134 affects its properties by allowing the partial absence of auxiliary linkers, leading to structural defects while preserving framework integrity. The dichromate uptake of PCN-134 is specifically tuned by adjusting the BTB/TCPP ratios, demonstrating how defect density control can affect MOF properties.",

      "question": "What role does the Zr6 cluster play in the synthesis of mixed-linker Zr-MOFs, and why is it considered attractive for this purpose?",
      "answer": "The Zr6 cluster plays the role of a highly stable and tunably connective building block in the synthesis of mixed-linker Zr-MOFs. It is considered attractive for this purpose due to its superior stability, tunable connectivity, and extraordinary tolerance of defects, making it ideal for constructing mixed-linker MOFs with various linker ratios.",

      "question": "Describe the synthetic strategy used to achieve mixed-linker Zr-MOFs and mention the specific mixed-linker Zr-MOFs synthesized using this strategy.",
      "answer": "The synthetic strategy used to achieve mixed-linker Zr-MOFs involves a thermodynamically guided approach where linkers are selected rationally to integrate within a Zr-MOF structure, considering that a combination of two linkers should give rise to a highly connected Zr-MOF as a thermodynamically favored product. Using this strategy, two specific mixed-linker Zr-MOFs synthesized are Zr6O4[OH]4[BTB]2[DCDPS] (PCN-133) and Zr6O4[OH]6[H2O]2[BTB]2[TCPP] (PCN-134).",

      "question": "What is the significance of controlling the defect density in PCN-134, and how is it achieved?",
      "answer": "Controlling the defect density in PCN-134 is significant for tuning the material's properties, such as porosity and chemical stability, which in turn affects its behavior in applications like adsorption and catalysis. It is achieved by systematically adjusting the occupancy of the auxiliary linker (TCPP), demonstrating a method to control MOF defects and properties.",

    {
      "question": "How does the introduction of auxiliary linkers affect the structure and properties of mixed-linker Zr-MOFs?",
      "answer": "The introduction of auxiliary linkers, such as DCDPS and TCPP, into mixed-linker Zr-MOFs affects the structure by extending the Zr-BTB layer into a 3D network, creating a layer-pillar structure. This structural arrangement enhances the porosity and chemical stability of the MOFs, and allows for the tuning of properties like defect density and adsorption capacity by adjusting the linker ratios.",

      "answer": "The thermodynamically guided synthesis strategy for mixed-linker Zr-MOFs addresses challenges related to achieving high structural connectivity and chemical stability in MOFs. It overcomes the limitations of previous methods by enabling the integration of multiple linkers with distinct functionalities into a stable, highly connected framework, thus enhancing the tunability and application potential of Zr-MOFs.",

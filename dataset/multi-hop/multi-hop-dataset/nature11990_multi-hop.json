      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What was the main challenge in determining the structure of miyakosyne A?",
      "answer": "The main challenge in determining the structure of miyakosyne A was the determination of the absolute configuration at C14, as conventional spectroscopic and chemical methods were ineffective due to the small difference between the two long alkyl groups on C14.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What was the incorrect conclusion made in the original paper regarding miyakosyne A, as mentioned in the corrigendum?",
      "answer": "The incorrect conclusion made in the original paper regarding miyakosyne A was the assignment of stereochemistry at C14, which was later found to be incorrect.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The correction regarding miyakosyne A's stereochemistry affects the other conclusions of the original paper.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How was the guest inclusion crystal prepared for X-ray diffraction analysis?",
      "answer": "The guest inclusion crystal was prepared by treating a tiny crystal of 3 with a solution of the guest compound, allowing the solvent to evaporate slowly in an incubator, and then directly mounting the crystal onto a single-crystal X-ray diffractometer.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The experiment with cyclohexanone (5) involved soaking a crystal of 2 in a drop of cyclohexanone at room temperature for 2 days.",
      "answer": "True",

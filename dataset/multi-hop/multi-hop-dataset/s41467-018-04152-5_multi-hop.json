          "context": "The synthesis conditions and structural analysis of a series of Zr-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with optimized pore structure for efficient separation of C6 alkane isomers are described. The MOFs, namely Zr-bptc, Zr-abtc, and Zr-tptc-(Me)2, exhibit different topologies (ftw, scu, and lvt, respectively) due to the varying aspect ratios of the organic linkers used in their synthesis. The ftw topology of Zr-bptc, with its cubic cage-like pores and small window aperture, selectively adsorbs n-hexane over its branched isomers. Zr-abtc, with a scu topology and 1D channels, discriminates all three C6 isomers and shows a high separation factor for 3-methylpentane over 2,3-dimethylbutane. The stability and porosity of these MOFs are also discussed, with Zr-bptc showing exceptional thermal and water stability.",

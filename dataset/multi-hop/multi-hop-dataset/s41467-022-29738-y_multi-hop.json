    {
      "question": "Is the bending rate of U-CB[8]-MPyVB faster or slower compared to other photoresponsive crystal materials, and why?",
      "answer": "The bending rate of U-CB[8]-MPyVB is slower compared to other photoresponsive crystal materials. This slower rate is attributed to factors such as the confinement effect of CB[8], the presence of both photoactive and photoinert motifs, and the structural restrictions imposed by CB[8] that limit the extent of photodimerization-induced structural changes.",

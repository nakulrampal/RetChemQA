      "question": "What changes were observed in the powder X-ray diffraction patterns of Zn–PYI1 after the alkylation reaction?",
      "answer": "The powder X-ray diffraction patterns of Zn–PYI1 after the alkylation reaction showed that the crystallinity of Zn–PYI1 was maintained, as evidenced by the similarity between the patterns of Zn–PYI1 after the reaction and the as-synthesized Zn–BCIP1.",

    {
      "question": "Is the catalytic activity of Zn–PYI1 maintained after recycling?",
      "answer": "Yes, the catalytic activity of Zn–PYI1 is maintained after recycling, as indicated by the slight decrease in yield and enantiomeric excess (ee) values after three rounds of recycling.",

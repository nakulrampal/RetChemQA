      "answer": "A suspension of 20.0 mg (0.144 mmol) of 2,5-diaminobenzoquinone, 121 mg of Fe(SO4)·7H2O (0.434 mmol), and 250 mg of tetrabutylammonium bromide (0.775 mmol) in 3.0 mL of deionized water titrated to a pH of 3.0 with concentrated HCl was loaded into a thick-walled borosilicate tube. The reaction suspension was degassed via four freeze–pump–thaw cycles, following which the tube was flame-sealed and loaded into an oven set to 120 °C for 24 hours.",

      "question": "What method was used for the synthesis of Na0.9(NBu4)1.8FeIII2(dhbq)3 (2)?",
      "answer": "Cubic crystals of 1 were ground into a microcrystalline powder, then a stirred suspension of 50 mg (0.049 mmol) of 1 in 3.0 mL of THF was prepared. Na-naphthalenide was prepared by stirring 6.3 mg (0.049 mmol) of naphthalene over a roughly 10-fold excess of sodium metal in 2.0 mL of THF for 3 hours. The resulting solution was filtered and added dropwise to the stirred suspension of 1 in THF at room temperature and stirred for 12 hours.",

      "answer": "The black color of (NBu4)2FeIII2(dhbq)3 (1) is an early indication of the intervalence charge transfer present in the compound, as coordination solids composed solely of the dianionic dhbq2– ligand are typically bright or dark red. This suggests that electron transfer had taken place during synthesis.",

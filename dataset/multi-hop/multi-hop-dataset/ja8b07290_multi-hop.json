      "question": "What is the synthesis procedure for CMOM-3S?",
      "answer": "A 5 mL methanol solution of 0.4 mmol Co(CF3SO3)2·6H2O (180 mg) and 0.4 mmol enantiopure (S)-mandelic acid (60.8mg) was layered above a 5 mL 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB) solution of 0.3 mmol 4,4’-bipyridine (bpy, 46.8 mg). A buffer solution of a 5mL 1:1 methanol/DCB was layered between the top and bottom layers to allow slow diffusion for 7 days, resulting in red rectangular prismatic crystals in ~60% yield.",

    {
      "question": "How were the CMOM samples activated for gas sorption studies?",
      "answer": "Crystals of as-synthesized CMOMs were exchanged with dichloromethane (DCM) daily for 5 days to successfully remove DCB/BTF. The exchanged crystals were evacuated under dynamic vacuum at room temperature until the outgassing rate of each sample was below the limit of detection (<1 µm Hg/min) during 16-24 hours of evacuation.",

      "question": "What method was used to measure water vapor isotherms at ambient temperature?",
      "answer": "Water vapor isotherms were measured at ambient temperature using a Quantachrome Autosorb iQ equipped with a vapor generator chamber.",

    {
      "question": "What was the purpose of the accelerated stability testing conditions applied to CMOMs?",
      "answer": "The accelerated stability testing conditions of 75% humidity at 40 °C for 7 days were applied to CMOMs to detect if the sample had been affected by exposure to humidity by characterizing them with PXRD and surface area measurements after incubation.",

    {
      "question": "What was the result of the DFT calculations on the desolvated 13R, 33R, and 43R structures?",
      "answer": "The DFT calculations on the desolvated 13R, 33R, and 43R structures indicated no significant difference in the orientation of the mandelate linkers in the unperturbed structures after removing the solvent.",

      "question": "True or False: The binding energy of water varies significantly between the three CMOM structures 13R, 33R, and 43R.",
      "answer": "False. The binding energy of water varies only slightly between the three structures and shows no clear distinction to indicate why 33R uptakes H2O while 13R and 43R do not.",

    {
      "question": "What does the sharp band above 3670 cm−1 in the IR spectra of CMOMs indicate?",
      "answer": "The sharp band above 3670 cm−1 in the IR spectra of CMOMs can be interpreted as originating from water screened by the CF3 end of the CF3SO3−, indicating isolated water molecules next to triflate anions.",

    {
      "question": "True or False: The presence of one water molecule in the CMOM structures affects the pore size compared to those of the ground state.",
      "answer": "False. The presence of one water molecule in these structures does not affect the pore size in comparison to those of the ground state.",

    {
      "question": "What was the main structural difference observed between the CMOMs studied in the DFT calculations?",
      "answer": "The main structural difference observed between the CMOMs studied in the DFT calculations was the substitution of the mandelate ligands.",

    {
      "question": "True or False: The CMOMs studied are stable to humidity as confirmed by PXRD.",
      "answer": "True. Unlike many MOFs that collapse after exposure to water vapor, the CMOMs studied herein are stable to humidity as confirmed by PXRD.",

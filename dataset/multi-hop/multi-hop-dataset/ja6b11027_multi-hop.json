      "answer": "Re<sup>I</sup>(CO)<sub>3</sub>(BPYDC)­Cl serves as a CO<sub>2</sub>-to-CO conversion photocatalyst that is covalently attached within a zirconium MOF to enhance CO<sub>2</sub> reduction activity and stability.",

      "question": "How does the density of Re<sup>I</sup>(CO)<sub>3</sub>(BPYDC)­Cl affect the photocatalytic activity of MOFs?",
      "answer": "The highest photocatalytic activity was found for MOFs with a density of 3 Re<sup>I</sup>(CO)<sub>3</sub>(BPYDC)­Cl complexes per unit cell, indicating that an optimum number of Re complexes is necessary for enhanced activity.",

      "answer": "Coating Re<sub>3</sub>-MOF on Ag nanocubes results in a 7-fold enhancement of CO<sub>2</sub>-to-CO conversion under visible light due to the intensified near-surface electric fields at the surface of Ag nanocubes.",

      "question": "Why does the photocatalytic activity of MOFs decrease when the density of Re<sup>I</sup>(CO)<sub>3</sub>(BPYDC)­Cl exceeds 4 per unit cell?",
      "answer": "When the density of Re<sup>I</sup>(CO)<sub>3</sub>(BPYDC)­Cl exceeds 4 per unit cell, the likelihood of Re complexes occupying adjacent linkers increases, leading to weak interactions between contiguous overlapping ReTCs that are not favorable for reducing CO<sub>2</sub> and thus decrease activity.",

      "answer": "False, there was no activity observed in Ag⊂Re<sub>0</sub>-MOF, which lacks Re<sup>I</sup>(CO)<sub>3</sub>(BPYDC)­Cl in the MOF layer, ruling out the possibility of Ag being responsible for CO production.",

      "question": "Can the photocatalytic activity of Re<sub>3</sub>-MOF be attributed to the proximity of photoactive centers?",
      "answer": "Yes, the increase in photocatalytic activity from Re<sub>1</sub> to Re<sub>3</sub> suggests that the bimolecular reaction pathway, which involves proximity between photoactive centers, is the source of higher turnover.",

    {
      "question": "Does the photocatalytic activity enhancement observed in Ag⊂Re<sub>3</sub>-MOF depend on the thickness of the MOF layer?",
      "answer": "True, a thinner Re<sub>3</sub>-MOF layer on Ag nanocubes leads to superior turnover due to the stronger electric field influence on average, resulting in up to 7-fold enhancement of photocatalytic activity.",

    {
      "question": "Is the photocatalytic CO<sub>2</sub> conversion activity of Cu⊂Re<sub>2</sub>-MOF enhanced in a similar manner to Ag⊂Re<sub>3</sub>-MOF?",
      "answer": "False, activity enhancement was not observed in Cu⊂Re<sub>2</sub>-MOF as the Cu nanoparticles do not have localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) characteristics that match the absorption features of ReTC.",

      "question": "Does the photocatalytic CO<sub>2</sub> conversion activity of Re<sub>3</sub>-MOF decrease in the absence of CO<sub>2</sub>?",
      "answer": "True, in the absence of CO<sub>2</sub> (under Ar atmosphere), there was no CO generation observed, indicating that the presence of CO<sub>2</sub> is essential for the photocatalytic activity of Re<sub>3</sub>-MOF.",

      "question": "What is the chemical formula of the metal-organic salt used in the study for reversible cyclobutane ring cleavage?",
      "answer": "K2SDC",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the two polymorphs of K2SDC mentioned, and how do their molecular arrangements differ?",
      "answer": "The two polymorphs of K2SDC mentioned are the one with a parallel molecular arrangement and the one with a herringbone structure. The parallel arrangement is found in the dehydrated crystals prepared directly from hydrated crystals, while the herringbone structure is observed in the anhydrous form obtained through high-temperature synthesis.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does the recrystallization temperature play in the formation of K2SDC polymorphs?",
      "answer": "The recrystallization temperature controls the molecular arrangement of the K2SDC polymorphs, leading to either a parallel or herringbone arrangement of the SDC ligands.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the structural difference between the two polymorphs of K2SDC affect their photoemissive properties?",
      "answer": "The structural difference between the two polymorphs of K2SDC affects their photoemissive properties by influencing the emission intensities. The herringbone structure is more emissive compared to the parallel structure.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What experimental technique confirmed the reversible photodimerization/thermal cleavage of K2SDC?",
      "answer": "Powder X-ray Diffraction (PXRD) techniques and 1H NMR spectroscopy confirmed the reversible photodimerization/thermal cleavage of K2SDC.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the high thermal stability of K2SDC and its polymorphs?",
      "answer": "The high thermal stability of K2SDC and its polymorphs is significant because it allows for the observation of reversible formation and cleavage of cyclobutane rings, making these materials suitable for applications in optical recording, photoswitching, and sensing.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why was the maximum photoconversion of K2SDC not achieved even with prolonged UV irradiation?",
      "answer": "The maximum photoconversion of K2SDC was not achieved even with prolonged UV irradiation due to the theoretical maximum yield predicted by the recurrence relations in the infinitely parallel arrangement of the double bonds, which limits the conversion to 82-87%.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does dehydration affect the reversible SCSC [2+2] reaction in K2SDC?",
      "answer": "Dehydration affects the reversible SCSC [2+2] reaction in K2SDC by changing the crystal packing from a parallel to a herringbone structure, which influences the stability and reactivity of the crystals during the reaction.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of UV light and heat in the reversible cyclobutane formation and cleavage in K2SDC?",
      "answer": "UV light induces the [2+2] cycloaddition reaction leading to cyclobutane formation, while heat causes the thermal cleavage of the cyclobutane ring, making the process reversible.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is the herringbone structure of K2SDC more favorable for maintaining single-crystal nature during photodimerization?",
      "answer": "The herringbone structure of K2SDC is more favorable for maintaining single-crystal nature during photodimerization because it provides better structural integrity and stability under the conditions of the reaction, unlike the parallel structure which is more fragile.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the presence of water affect the reversible SCSC transformation in K2SDC?",
      "answer": "The presence of water leads to the formation of hydrated salts, which upon dehydration can either retain or change their crystal packing, affecting the reversible SCSC transformation by influencing the molecular arrangement and stability of the crystals.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What determines the photochemical conversion ratio in the SCSC transformation of K2SDC?",
      "answer": "The photochemical conversion ratio in the SCSC transformation of K2SDC is determined by the occupancy factors of the dimer and monomer components in the crystal structure, which reflect the extent of photoreaction.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The reversible cyclobutane formation and cleavage in K2SDC can only occur in the single-crystal state.",

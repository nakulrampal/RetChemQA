      "question": "What is the role of temperature in the photophysical properties of HPI2C and LIFM-101?",
      "answer": "Temperature affects the photophysical properties of HPI2C and LIFM-101 by promoting vibrational relaxation (VR), which reduces the proportion of intersystem crossing (ISC) and ultimately leads to the decrease in the triplet state portion. Additionally, temperature influences the intensity and decay lifetime of fluorescence and phosphorescence peaks, affecting the overall photoluminescence color.",

      "question": "How does the decay lifetime of fluorescence at 450 nm in LIFM-101 change with temperature?",
      "answer": "The decay lifetime of fluorescence at 450 nm in LIFM-101 increases with temperature, indicating a temperature-dependent photophysical behavior.",

      "question": "What phenomenon is observed in LIFM-101 and HPI2C after the removal of the irradiation source at different temperatures?",
      "answer": "Both LIFM-101 and HPI2C exhibit color-tuned long persistent luminescence (LPL) after the removal of the irradiation source at different temperatures, with LIFM-101 showing a more prominent effect.",

    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the twisted structure of the HPI2C ligand in LIFM-101?",
      "answer": "The twisted structure of the HPI2C ligand in LIFM-101 facilitates the mixing of higher-energy excited states, which are beneficial to unique photophysical processes like higher-energy reverse intersystem crossing (hRISC).",

      "question": "What is the effect of introducing a benzene ring with a carboxyl group onto the ESIPT ligand in the synthesis of LIFM-101?",
      "answer": "Introducing a benzene ring with a carboxyl group onto the ESIPT ligand in the synthesis of LIFM-101 successfully separates the ESIPT site from the coordination site and obtains a highly distorted structure between the carboxyl-benzene ring and the central imidazole unit, which is beneficial for photophysical processes.",

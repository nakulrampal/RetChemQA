    {
      "question": "Why is a high Qst generally undesirable for adsorptive gas storage in MOFs?",
      "answer": "A high Qst leads to relatively high uptake at low pressure, thereby reducing the working capacity, which is undesirable for adsorptive gas storage in MOFs.",

    {
      "question": "How does the change in pore surface chemistry from NJU-Bai 41 to NJU-Bai 43 influence methane adsorption at low pressure?",
      "answer": "The change in pore surface chemistry, such as the introduction of polar amide moieties and pyridyl groups, decreases CH4-framework interactions, leading to lower methane adsorption at low pressure.",

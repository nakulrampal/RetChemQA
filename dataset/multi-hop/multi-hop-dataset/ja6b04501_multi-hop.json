      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the effect of substituents on MOF linkers on the resulting MOF structures?",
      "answer": "The substituents on MOF linkers can affect the conformation of linkers, which in turn changes the vertex geometry, structure dimensionality, and topology of resulting frameworks.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does the linker installation method contribute to the engineering of pore environments in MOFs?",
      "answer": "The linker installation method allows for the precise placement of different functionalities into Zr-MOFs under mild conditions, enabling systematic variation of pore volume and decoration of pore environment.",

    {
      "question": "What is the significance of kinetic control in the synthesis of PCN-700?",
      "answer": "Kinetic control is significant in the synthesis of PCN-700 as it allows for the formation of the desired PCN-700 structure by preventing the formation of competing phases, such as UiO structures, through the introduction of bulky substituents on the linkers.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The linker installation method can only introduce a single type of functional group into the MOF structure.",
      "answer": "False",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does the linker length play in the linker installation method for MOFs?",
      "answer": "The linker length plays a crucial role in the linker installation method as it determines the compatibility of the linker with the MOF structure, affecting the systematic variation of pore volume and the decoration of the pore environment.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The PCN-700 MOF structure remains unchanged regardless of the type of linker installed.",
      "answer": "False",

      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the introduction of functional groups into Zr-MOFs affect their gas adsorption capacities?",
      "answer": "The introduction of functional groups into Zr-MOFs through linker installation can enhance their gas adsorption capacities due to the systematic variation of pore volume and the decoration of the pore environment.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"

    {
      "question": "What is the impact of temperature on the phase of MOFs synthesized using different linkers?",
      "answer": "The temperature impacts the phase of MOFs synthesized using different linkers by controlling the balance between kinetic and thermodynamic products, with lower temperatures favoring the formation of the desired PCN-700 phase.",

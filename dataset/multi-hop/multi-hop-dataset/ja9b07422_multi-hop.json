      "question": "What are the unique properties of NJU-Bai53 compared to NJU-Bai52?",
      "answer": "NJU-Bai53 exhibits exceptional thermal stability, water stability, and highly selective CO2 capture properties with higher uptakes and selectivity than NJU-Bai52.",

      "question": "How does the synthesis condition of NJU-Bai53 differ from NJU-Bai52?",
      "answer": "NJU-Bai53 is synthesized using ScCl3·6H2O, TPBTM, HNO3, and DMF at 130 °C for 2 days, while NJU-Bai52 uses FeCl3·6H2O, TPBTM, CH3COOH, and DMF at 130 °C for 5 days.",

      "question": "What role does the TPBTM ligand play in the structure of NJU-Bai52 and NJU-Bai53?",
      "answer": "The TPBTM ligand acts as a 12-connected supramolecular connector being linked by M3O clusters to form the highly connected and isostructural MOFs NJU-Bai52 and NJU-Bai53.",

    {
      "question": "Why might NJU-Bai53 be considered a better candidate for CO2 capture compared to NJU-Bai52?",
      "answer": "NJU-Bai53 has significantly improved CO2 uptake and higher selectivity due to the balanced charge on the M3O clusters being finely tuned from Cl- ion to monodentate hydroxide anion, leading to better interaction with CO2 molecules.",

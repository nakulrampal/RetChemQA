      "question": "What is the significance of the Förster energy transfer distance in the context of truMOF-1 and truMOF-2?",
      "answer": "The Förster energy transfer distance is significant because it indicates the efficiency of energy transfer between the ligands (antenna molecules) and the embedded coumarin dye molecules (acceptors) within truMOF-1 and truMOF-2. It helps in understanding the energy transport dynamics and the role of exciton jumping beyond nearest neighbors in these MOFs.",

      "question": "Based on the synthesis conditions, what are the differences between truMOF-1 and truMOF-2?",
      "answer": "The main difference in the synthesis conditions between truMOF-1 and truMOF-2 is the presence of H2O in the mixed solution for truMOF-1, which is absent in the mixed solution for truMOF-2. Both MOFs are synthesized at 90 °C for 2 days but with slightly different solvent compositions.",

      "question": "What are the implications of exciton jumping beyond nearest neighbors in truMOF-1 and truMOF-2?",
      "answer": "Exciton jumping beyond nearest neighbors in truMOF-1 and truMOF-2 implies that energy transfer within these MOFs is not limited to adjacent ligands but can occur over longer distances. This significantly enhances the efficiency of energy transport to the coumarin dye molecules, mimicking the energy funneling seen in natural photosynthetic systems.",

      "question": "How does the inclusion of water in the synthesis solution affect the formation of truMOF-1 compared to truMOF-2?",
      "answer": "The inclusion of water in the synthesis solution for truMOF-1, as opposed to its absence in the synthesis of truMOF-2, suggests that water may play a role in the formation or the structural characteristics of truMOF-1. This difference in solvent composition could influence the crystallization process, leading to variations in the properties or structures of the resulting MOFs.",

    {
      "question": "Why does framework 2 have the most electrostatically stabilized site for CO2 binding?",
      "answer": "Framework 2 has the most electrostatically stabilized site for CO2 binding due to its strong negative potentials near the carbon atom of CO2 and the largest positive potentials around the oxygen atoms of CO2.",

    {
      "question": "How do the electrostatic interactions between CO2 molecules and the MOF frameworks determine their positions within the frameworks?",
      "answer": "The electrostatic interactions between CO2 molecules and the MOF frameworks determine their positions by forming attractive interactions where the molecular electrostatic potentials (MEPs) and framework electrostatic potentials (FEPs) display opposite coloring, thereby stabilizing the CO2 molecules within the frameworks.",

    {
      "question": "What role do dispersion interactions play in stabilizing CO2 molecules within framework 1?",
      "answer": "In framework 1, CO2 molecules are mostly stabilized by dispersion interactions (London forces) due to little overall electrostatic stabilization between the CO2 molecules and the host framework.",

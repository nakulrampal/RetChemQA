      "question": "What are the synthesis conditions for K14ZnGe16 and Rb14ZnGe16?",
      "answer": "K14ZnGe16 was first obtained during exploratory syntheses in the K–Zn–Ge system. Attempts to synthesize analogous compounds with other alkali metals Na, Rb, and Cs were only successful in the case of Rb. The synthesis involved heating to 650 °C at a rate of 5 K min−1, holding this temperature for 24 h, cooling to 450 °C with 0.1 K min−1 and holding 3 d at 450 °C, cooling to 390 °C with 0.1 K min−1, and holding 5 d at 390 °C, then quenching to room temperature.",

      "answer": "The structural difference between K14ZnGe16 and Rb14ZnGe16 lies in the size of the alkali metal, which affects the lattice parameters. With the increasing size of the alkali metal from K to Rb, the lattice parameters increase from a = 20.1357(5) Å, b = 6.9934(2) Å, c = 14.0398(5) Å for K14ZnGe16 to a = 20.8718(6) Å, b = 7.2103(2) Å, c = 14.4434(4) Å for Rb14ZnGe16.",

      "answer": "The [(η3-Ge4)Zn(η2-Ge4)]6− cluster in K14ZnGe16 comprises two (Ge4) tetrahedra linked by a Zn atom. One (Ge4) tetrahedron coordinates with a triangular face (η3), and the other one with an edge (η2). This cluster represents a new isomer of the [(Ge4)Zn(Ge4)]6− anion in Cs6ZnGe8. The Zn–Ge cluster shows significant structural differences due to bonding interactions between the Ge and Zn atoms, with Ge–Ge distances between two Ge atoms involved in the coordination to the Zn atom being significantly longer than the other Ge–Ge distances in the Zn–Ge cluster.",

      "question": "How does the solubility of K14ZnGe16 in liquid ammonia contribute to Zintl anion chemistry?",
      "answer": "The solubility of K14ZnGe16 in liquid ammonia contributes to Zintl anion chemistry by providing a rare example of a soluble Zintl phase with deltahedral units that can be used as precursors for solution-based group 14 element Zintl anion cluster chemistry. This solubility allowed for the reaction of K14ZnGe16 with MesCu in the presence of [18]-crown-6 in liquid ammonia, leading to the isolation of the [(MesCu)2Ge4]4− cluster, which completes the series of tetrahedral [E4]4− species isolated from solution for E = Si, Sn, and Pb, providing the 'missing link' for E = Ge.",

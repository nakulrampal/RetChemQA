      "question": "What is the main challenge in separating enantiomers in the pharmaceutical industry, and how does TAMOF-1 address this issue?",
      "answer": "The main challenge in separating enantiomers in the pharmaceutical industry is the high cost and lack of versatility of current chiral stationary phases, which are poorly robust, expensive to manufacture, and often too specific for a single desired substrate. TAMOF-1, a porous, robust homochiral metal–organic framework built from copper(II) and an affordable linker prepared from natural L-histidine, addresses this issue by being able to separate a variety of model racemic mixtures, including drugs, in a wide range of solvents of different polarity, outperforming several commercial chiral columns for HPLC separations.",

      "question": "How does TAMOF-1 achieve quantitative separation of (±)-ibuprofen and (±)-thalidomide?",
      "answer": "TAMOF-1 achieves quantitative separation of (±)-ibuprofen and (±)-thalidomide by utilizing a glass column packed with TAMOF-1, and running a solution of the racemic mixture through the column using acetonitrile as the eluent. The two enantiomers descend through the column as different fronts, with enantiopure (S)-ibuprofen and (S)-thalidomide exiting the column first due to the preferred interaction of (R)-ibuprofen and (R)-thalidomide with TAMOF-1, resulting in a slower elution of these enantiomers.",

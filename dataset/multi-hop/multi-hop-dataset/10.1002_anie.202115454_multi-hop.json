    {
      "question": "Why did Si2-Pd and Sn2-Pd display different rates of decomposition in air?",
      "answer": "Si2-Pd and Sn2-Pd displayed different rates of decomposition in air due to the difference in the donor/acceptor properties of Si2 and Sn2, which affects the strength of the associated metal–phosphine bonds and thus their resistance to oxidation.",

    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the emission maxima being red-shifted for the MOFs compared to Pd(PPh3)4?",
      "answer": "The red-shifted emission maxima for the MOFs compared to Pd(PPh3)4 indicate that the ligands used in the MOFs are stronger π-acceptors relative to PPh3, which may explain their ability to readily displace PPh3 as a ligand for Pd0.",

    {
      "question": "Why did the use of Sn2 and 24 equivalents of PPh3 yield quality single crystals with a PXRD pattern matching that of Si2-Pd?",
      "answer": "The use of Sn2 and 24 equivalents of PPh3 yielded quality single crystals with a PXRD pattern matching that of Si2-Pd due to the similar isostructural nature of the materials, which was facilitated by the appropriate choice of ligand and modulator amount.",

    {
      "question": "What is the main focus of the study described in the manuscript?",
      "answer": "The main focus of the study is the cooperative adsorption of carbon disulfide (CS2) in diamine-appended metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), specifically examining the synthesis conditions, adsorption behavior, and the synthesis of different materials such as ZIF-1, ZIF-2, etc.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What technique was used to collect infrared spectra in the study?",
      "answer": "Infrared spectra were collected using a PerkinElmer Avatar Spectrum 400 FT–IR spectrophotometer in transmittance mode using KBr windows.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the adsorption behavior of CS2 in diamine-appended MOFs compare to CO2 based on the study?",
      "answer": "The study explores the cooperative adsorption mechanism of CS2 in diamine-appended MOFs, which was previously reported for CO2. It investigates whether this unique cooperative chemical adsorption mechanism, which involves insertion into metal–amine bonds coupled with proton transfer, can also apply to CS2.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What was the role of water in the adsorption process of CS2 in diamine-appended MOFs according to the study?",
      "answer": "The study investigates the effect of water on the adsorption process of CS2 in diamine-appended MOFs, examining whether the presence of water interferes with the chemically specific cooperative adsorption of CS2, similar to previous observations with CO2.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What specific structural feature of CS2-inserted mm-2–Zn2(dobpdc) was identified as unprecedented in the study?",
      "answer": "The study identified an unprecedented dithiocarbamate coordination mode in CS2-inserted mm-2–Zn2(dobpdc), where the dithiocarbamate acts as a monodentate ligand with a long Zn–S bond distance, which is unusual for dithiocarbamate ligands that typically form strong-field bidentate ligands.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The study concluded that CS2 adsorption in diamine-appended MOFs is fully reversible under all conditions.",
      "answer": "False. The study concluded that CS2 adsorption in diamine-appended MOFs is reversible under certain conditions, specifically in the Mg-based MOF, but not in Mn and Zn analogs where irreversible adsorption or deleterious thermolysis occurs.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The study found that the presence of water vapor significantly enhances the adsorption capacity of CS2 in diamine-appended MOFs.",
      "answer": "False. The study investigated the impact of water vapor on CS2 adsorption in diamine-appended MOFs, but it emphasized the chemical specificity of the adsorption process rather than enhancement by water vapor.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What was the primary method used to analyze the structure of CS2-inserted mm-2–Zn2(dobpdc) in the study?",
      "answer": "The primary method used to analyze the structure of CS2-inserted mm-2–Zn2(dobpdc) was single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD), which provided insights into the coordination mode and structure of the inserted CS2.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "Based on the study, how does the thiophilicity of the metal center affect the adsorption and reversibility of CS2 in diamine-appended MOFs?",
      "answer": "The study suggests that the thiophilicity of the metal center significantly affects both the adsorption threshold pressure and the reversibility of CS2 adsorption in diamine-appended MOFs. Mg, being less thiophilic, showed reversible adsorption, whereas Mn and Zn, with higher thiophilicity, showed irreversible adsorption or thermolysis.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The study exclusively focused on the adsorption of CS2 without considering the co-adsorption or interference of other gases like CO2 and water.",
      "answer": "False. The study considered the co-adsorption and interference of other gases like CO2 and water, examining the chemical specificity of the cooperative adsorption mechanism and its performance in the presence of these gases.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"

      "question": "What is the significance of the intermolecular linkage of the crystallographically independent units via the CO ligands trans to the carbene carbon in 4a?",
      "answer": "It is significant because it connects the monomeric zirconiumoxycarbene-W(CO)6 units in the solid specifically to give a polymeric helical molecular chain.",

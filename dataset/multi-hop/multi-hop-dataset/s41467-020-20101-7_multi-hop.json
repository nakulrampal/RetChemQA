    {
      "question": "How does the oxidation state of the linker atom in the MOFs influence their structure and gas separation performance?",
      "answer": "The oxidation state of the linker atom in the MOFs influences their structure by altering the surface electrostatic potential and linker conformation, which in turn changes the layer stacking pattern and intralayer channel structure. This affects the MOFs' gas separation performance by enabling fine regulation of interlayer and intralayer spaces for effective acetylene trapping and ethylene separation.",

      "question": "How do ZUL-100 and ZUL-200 MOFs achieve high acetylene uptake and selectivity?",
      "answer": "ZUL-100 and ZUL-200 achieve high acetylene uptake and selectivity through the deliberate creation of permanent interlayer space with desired size and chemistry, coupled with optimal intralayer channel structures. This enables strong interlayer trapping of acetylene molecules along with cooperative intralayer binding.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What role does the electrostatic potential play in the performance of ZUL-100 and ZUL-200 for gas separation?",
      "answer": "The electrostatic potential, altered by the oxidation state of the sulfur atom in the MOFs' linker, plays a crucial role in determining the stacking pattern of the layers and the conformation of the linkers. This affects the creation of interlayer and intralayer spaces, which are key for the efficient trapping of acetylene and separation from ethylene.",

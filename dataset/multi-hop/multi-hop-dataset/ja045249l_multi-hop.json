    {
      "question": "Why might compound 3 be more susceptible to oxidation upon exposure to air compared to compounds 1 and 2?",
      "answer": "Compound 3's higher susceptibility to oxidation upon air exposure could be due to its structural features and the presence of more reactive sites, as indicated by its different configurations of decagons, which might make it less stable compared to compounds 1 and 2.",

      "question": "What unique behavior does compound 5 exhibit compared to compounds 1−4?",
      "answer": "Compound 5 demonstrates a full 1-e− charge transfer from [Ru2II,II] to TCNQF4, leading to a formal resonance form [{Ru24.5+}-(TCNQF4•−)-{Ru24.5+}], and exhibits 3-D long-range antiferromagnetic order at 95 K, making it distinct from compounds 1−4.",

      "question": "What is the significance of the antiferromagnetic transition observed in compound 5 at around 95 K?",
      "answer": "The antiferromagnetic transition observed in compound 5 at around 95 K is significant because it accompanies a drastic change in ac conductivity, indicating that conduction electrons are interacting with localized magnetic spins, which is a key finding of the study.",

      "answer": "Hf-MOF-808-V and Zr-NU-1000-V were synthesized by immersing Hf-MOF-808 and Zr-NU-1000, respectively, in a 0.03 M V(O)(acac)2 solution of methanol for 3 days at room temperature, followed by washing with fresh methanol three times.",

      "question": "How were the vanadium loadings in Hf-MOF-808-V and Zr-NU-1000-V determined?",
      "answer": "The vanadium loadings in Hf-MOF-808-V and Zr-NU-1000-V were determined using Inductively Coupled Plasma – Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES), indicating vanadium loadings of 1.1 ± 0.2 and 1.0 ± 0.2 per node, respectively.",

      "question": "What changes were observed in the MOFs after the incorporation of vanadium species?",
      "answer": "After the incorporation of vanadium species, striking color changes were observed during the SIM process, indicating successful incorporation. Additionally, ligand-to-metal charge-transfer (LMCT) peaks centered at around 4.0 eV appeared in the diffuse reflectance UV spectra.",

      "question": "What was the effect of heat treatment on the catalytic activity of Hf-MOF-808-V?",
      "answer": "Heat treatment altered the locations of a fraction of the vanadium ions in Hf-MOF-808-V, resulting in significantly higher catalytic activity and an overall simplification of siting.",

      "answer": "Yes, the porosity of Hf-MOF-808-V and Zr-NU-1000-V is retained after V-SIM, as indicated by the slight decrease in Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas and the small decreases in their pore sizes.",

      "question": "How does the binding motif of vanadium oxide species differ between Hf-MOF-808-V and Zr-NU-1000-V?",
      "answer": "In Hf-MOF-808-V, the vanadium(V)-atom species were anchored on the metal oxide nodes with a chelating binding motif, while in Zr-NU-1000-V, the binding was both bridging and monodentate.",

    {
      "question": "What role does the support material play in the performance of vanadium oxide catalysts?",
      "answer": "The performance of vanadium oxide catalysts is often highly dependent on the identity of the support material, due to 'support effects' which are thought to derive from support-induced changes in the geometric and/or electronic structures of the active species.",

The main differences are the organic acids used (H2ADC for MOF-31 and H4ATC for MOF-32) and the metal salts (Zn(NO3)2 for MOF-31 and Cd(NO3)2 for MOF-32), as well as the synthesis conditions.",

      "answer": "The paddle-wheel cluster in MOF-36, where a zinc dimer is bridged by four dimonodentate carboxylates, represents the only SBU in its structure. This SBU decorates the Pt positions in the PtS network, leading to a decorated−expanded PtS network with 3-D pores filled with water and DMF guests.",

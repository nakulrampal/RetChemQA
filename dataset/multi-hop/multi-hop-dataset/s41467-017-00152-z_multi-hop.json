      "question": "What is the primary material synthesized in the study and what are its key components?",
      "answer": "The primary material synthesized in the study is ordered carbonaceous frameworks from an organic crystal of a Ni-containing cyclic porphyrin dimer (Ni2-CPDPy). Its key components include two Ni-porphyrins linked by two butadiyne (diacetylene) moieties through phenyl groups.",

      "question": "How does the Ni-N4 unit in the porphyrin ring contribute to the thermal stability of the material?",
      "answer": "The Ni-N4 unit in the porphyrin ring contributes to the thermal stability of the material by being thermally stable up to approximately 973 K.",

    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the diacetylene moieties in the synthesis process of the ordered carbonaceous frameworks?",
      "answer": "The diacetylene moieties are significant in the synthesis process because they are thermally polymerized to poly(diacetylene) to form a rigid crosslinked network, allowing the precursor morphology to be maintained during carbonization.",

      "question": "What role does nickel (Ni) play in the structure and properties of the synthesized material?",
      "answer": "Nickel (Ni) plays a crucial role in stabilizing the porphyrin against thermochemical decomposition, thereby achieving better yield and retaining the ordered structure. Additionally, Ni-N4 units embedded in the carbonaceous framework exhibit unique electrocatalysis for selective CO2 reduction into CO.",

    {
      "question": "Is the resulting ordered carbonaceous framework electrically conductive, and if so, what evidence supports this?",
      "answer": "Yes, the resulting ordered carbonaceous framework is electrically conductive. This is supported by the significant decrease in resistivity observed at room temperature for the samples carbonized at 873 K and 973 K, indicating that the material is a semiconductor.",

      "question": "True or False: The synthesis process of the ordered carbonaceous frameworks involves a single-step thermal conversion of Ni2-CPDPy.",
      "answer": "False. The synthesis process involves a two-step thermal conversion; first converting Ni2-CPDPy into a crystalline covalent-organic framework at 581 K, followed by carbonization at 873–1073 K to form ordered carbonaceous frameworks.",

    {
      "question": "True or False: The ordered carbonaceous frameworks synthesized in the study are not suitable for electrochemical applications due to their insulating nature.",

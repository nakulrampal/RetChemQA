      "question": "What is the significance of using a solvent-free methodology in the synthesis of multivariate ZIFs?",
      "answer": "The solvent-free methodology offers a versatile and applicable platform that allows the preparation of multivariate ZIFs, enabling the incorporation of bulkier ligands while retaining the sodalite topology. It provides a green synthetic route to construct mixed-ligand SOD ZIFs materials unapproachable by pure ligand synthesis, facilitating the design of ZIFs with network complexity and improving their chemical stability and hydrophobicity.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does the inclusion of different ligands affect the properties of ZIFs synthesized using the solvent-free method?",
      "answer": "The inclusion of different ligands, especially bulkier ones, in the synthesis of ZIFs using the solvent-free method can modify the physical properties of ZIFs, such as their pore size and gate-opening capacity. This approach allows for the fine-tuning of ZIF properties, such as enhancing their thermal stability and hydrophobic character, and potentially improving their stability towards water.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role do theoretical calculations play in understanding the phase stability of mixed-ligand ZIFs?",
      "answer": "Theoretical calculations, specifically Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, play a crucial role in assessing the phase stability of mixed-ligand ZIFs. They predict the most stable phases for each ligand composition and help rationalize the preference for certain topologies upon ligand mixing by considering factors like steric hindrance and inter-ligand interactions. These calculations provide insights into why certain ligand combinations favor the formation of specific ZIF topologies.",

    {
      "question": "What challenges are addressed by the solvent-free synthesis method in the creation of multivariate ZIFs?",
      "answer": "The solvent-free synthesis method addresses challenges such as the difficulty of incorporating bulkier ligands into ZIF structures through direct synthesis and the limitations of post-synthetic strategies that involve additional synthetic steps. It enables the direct and scalable synthesis of multivariate ZIFs with complex network structures, overcoming the limitations of conventional synthesis routes and post-synthetic modification techniques.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What impact does the combination of 2-ethylimidazole and 2-methylbenzimidazole have on the topology of ZIFs synthesized using the solvent-free method?",
      "answer": "The combination of 2-ethylimidazole and 2-methylbenzimidazole in the synthesis of ZIFs using the solvent-free method leads to the formation of SOD frameworks for different metal centers, despite these topologies not being obtained for the individual ligands. This combination allows for the creation of SOD ZIFs with enhanced properties, such as improved thermal stability and hydrophobicity.",

    {
      "question": "How does the solvent-free synthesis method contribute to the green chemistry approach in the creation of ZIFs?",
      "answer": "The solvent-free synthesis method contributes to the green chemistry approach by eliminating the need for solvents in the synthesis process, thereby reducing the environmental impact and enhancing the sustainability of the ZIF production process. It offers a cleaner, more efficient, and scalable approach to synthesizing ZIFs with complex network structures and tailored properties.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What advantages does the solvent-free synthesis method offer over post-synthetic modification techniques in the creation of ZIFs?",
      "answer": "The solvent-free synthesis method offers advantages over post-synthetic modification techniques by enabling the direct synthesis of ZIFs with complex and multivariate network structures without the need for additional synthetic steps. It allows for the incorporation of bulkier ligands and potentially different metals in the same framework, overcoming the limitations of post-synthetic strategies that often result in modifications only at the surface level and involve complex procedures.",

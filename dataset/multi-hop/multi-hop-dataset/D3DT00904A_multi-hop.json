      "question": "How does the coordination geometry of the cadmium(II) complex differ from its zinc(II) counterpart when synthesized with the same ligand?",
      "answer": "The cadmium(II) complex features an octahedral CdN2Cl4 coordination geometry and forms a 1D polymeric structure due to the bridging coordination of chlorido ligands.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What effect does the introduction of an oxygen atom in the ligand core have on the luminescence of the complexes?",
      "answer": "The introduction of the oxygen atom results in a drastic red-shift of the emission band due to short-range charge transfer, leading to an order of magnitude larger Stokes shifts.",

      "question": "What behavior do LO and its complexes exhibit when transitioning from solution to the solid state, according to photoluminescence quantum yields?",

      "question": "True or False: The zinc(II) and cadmium(II) complexes with the oxygen-free 4,5-diazafluorene ligand exhibit larger Stokes shifts compared to their oxygen-containing counterparts.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What is the impact of the oxygen atom in the ligand core on the differences between the S0 and S1 geometries of the ligands and complexes?",
      "answer": "The presence of the oxygen atom in the ligand core makes the differences between the S0 and S1 geometries much more pronounced for LO and LO-based compounds than those of their oxygen-free analogues, leading to larger Stokes shifts.",

      "question": "What is the DOI of the research article discussing Ambient-Temperature Hydrogen Storage via Vanadium(II)-Dihydrogen Complexation in a Metal–Organic Framework?",
      "answer": "10.1021/jacs.1c01883",

      "question": "Which metal-organic framework (MOF) is reported to have exposed vanadium(II) sites capable of backbonding with weak π acids for hydrogen storage?",
      "answer": "V2Cl2.8(btdd)",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the enthalpy of hydrogen adsorption for the MOF V2Cl2.8(btdd), and why is this value significant for ambient-temperature hydrogen storage?",
      "answer": "The enthalpy of hydrogen adsorption for V2Cl2.8(btdd) is −21 kJ/mol. This value is significant because it falls within the optimal range of −15 to −25 kJ/mol for ambient-temperature hydrogen storage, enabling usable hydrogen capacities that exceed that of compressed storage under the same operating conditions.",

      "question": "What techniques were used to characterize the Kubas-type vanadium(II)–dihydrogen complexation in V2Cl2.8(btdd)?",
      "answer": "The Kubas-type vanadium(II)–dihydrogen complexation in V2Cl2.8(btdd) was characterized using a combination of techniques including powder neutron diffraction data, in situ infrared spectroscopy, and electronic structure calculations.",

    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the V–D2(centroid) distance obtained from powder neutron diffraction data for V2Cl2.8(btdd)?",
      "answer": "The V–D2(centroid) distance of 1.966(8) Å obtained from powder neutron diffraction data for V2Cl2.8(btdd) is significant because it is the shortest yet reported for a MOF, consistent with a Kubas-type interaction.",

    {
      "question": "True or False: The total volumetric hydrogen uptake in V2Cl2.8(btdd) at 298 K and 100 bar is lower than that in Ni2(m-dobdc) under the same conditions.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of exposed metal sites in hydrogen storage within metal-organic frameworks, as exemplified by V2Cl2.8(btdd)?",
      "answer": "The role of exposed metal sites in hydrogen storage within metal-organic frameworks, as exemplified by V2Cl2.8(btdd), is to enable strong and selective adsorption of hydrogen through orbital-mediated interactions, particularly backbonding, which can lead to enhanced hydrogen storage capacities under ambient conditions.",

      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What challenges are associated with on-board hydrogen storage for transportation, and how does V2Cl2.8(btdd) address these challenges?",
      "answer": "The challenges associated with on-board hydrogen storage for transportation include the need for high pressures or cryogenic temperatures to achieve reasonable storage densities. V2Cl2.8(btdd) addresses these challenges by binding H2 with an enthalpy of −21 kJ/mol, enabling ambient-temperature hydrogen storage at moderate pressures and offering usable hydrogen capacities that exceed those of compressed storage under the same operating conditions.",

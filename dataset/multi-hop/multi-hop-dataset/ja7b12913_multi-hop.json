      "question": "What is the primary objective of the study described in the text?",
      "answer": "The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate the solid-gas phase, single-crystal-to-single-crystal, postsynthetic functionalization of a metal-organic framework (MOF) using ozone.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "Which MOF is used as the starting material for postsynthetic modification in the study?",
      "answer": "The MOF used as the starting material for postsynthetic modification is ZrEBDC.",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the final products obtained after the ozonolysis and subsequent workup of ZrEBDC?",
      "answer": "The final products obtained are aldehydes or carboxylic acids.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How is the degree of conversion of olefinic groups into 1,2,4-trioxolane rings monitored?",
      "answer": "The degree of conversion is monitored by recording the 1H NMR spectra of the digested samples and comparing the integration of specific peaks.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the BET measurements reported in the study?",
      "answer": "The BET measurements are significant as they provide information on the surface area of the MOF before and after the postsynthetic modifications, indicating changes in porosity.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The study demonstrates a method for the postsynthetic modification of MOFs that preserves the crystallinity of the material.",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What experimental technique is used to confirm the formation of 1,2,4-trioxolane rings in the MOF?",
      "answer": "The formation of 1,2,4-trioxolane rings is confirmed by solid-state 13C NMR spectroscopy.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The ozonolysis reaction described in the study requires high temperatures and long reaction times.",
      "answer": "False",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of the KI solution in the ozonolysis setup?",
      "answer": "The KI solution acts as a color-based indicator of ozonolysis progression, changing from colorless to yellow to indicate full conversion.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The study provides a method for selectively converting the olefin groups in a MOF to either aldehydes or carboxylic acids without losing the material's single-crystallinity.",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"

      "question": "What is the primary purpose of incorporating acetylene or vinyl substituents into ZIFs according to the text?",
      "answer": "The primary purpose is to induce hypergolic behavior in MOFs by using acetylene and vinyl substituents to unlock the latent energetic properties of electron-deficient linkers in a ZIF.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the formation of coordination bonds in ZIFs affect their hypergolic behavior compared to the free ligand?",
      "answer": "The formation of coordination bonds in a ZIF improves hypergolic behavior compared to the free ligand, making the design of hypergolic MOFs different from strategies for making other types of energetic MOFs.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role do metal nodes play in the hypergolic properties of ZIFs?",
      "answer": "Metal nodes, particularly Co2+ compared to Zn2+ and Cd2+, play a significant role in the hypergolic properties of ZIFs, potentially due to their open d-shell configuration and the ability to undergo redox reactions, which can influence the reactivity and ignition delay of the ZIFs.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the ability to include an oxidizer within the MOF structure critical for its hypergolic response?",
      "answer": "No, the ability to include the oxidizer in the MOF is not critical for hypergolic response, as demonstrated by Zn(AIm)2 and Co(AIm)2 materials saturated with nitromethane still exhibiting ultrashort ignition delays.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The hypergolic MOFs retain their hypergolic activity upon storage, making them suitable for applications in solid fuels.",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the calculated bandgaps in relation to the hypergolic performance of ZIFs?",
      "answer": "The calculated bandgaps indicate that a reduction in the bandgap correlates with an increase in the reactivity of hypergolic MOFs, suggesting that differences in hypergolicity of MOFs based on different metals should be related to their electronic structure.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The acetylene or vinyl triggers significantly increase the overall energetic content of the ZIFs.",
      "answer": "False",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What method is used to measure the ignition delay (ID) for hypergolic ZIFs?",
      "answer": "The ignition delay (ID) for hypergolic ZIFs is measured using a standard drop test, where a liquid oxidizer is dropped onto the solid fuel MOF, and the time between contact and ignition is recorded.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the choice of metal and linker components in ZIFs affect their ignition and combustion properties?",
      "answer": "Varying the metal and linker components in ZIFs enables the modulation of ignition and combustion properties, including achieving ultrashort ignition delays, without changing the overall structure of the fuel.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: Physical mixtures of pure ligands with metal sources exhibit better hypergolic behavior than the corresponding ZIFs.",
      "answer": "False",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"

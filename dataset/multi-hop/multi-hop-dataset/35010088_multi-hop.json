    {
      "question": "How does the degree of N-methylation of the free pyridyl groups in POST-1 affect its catalytic activity in the transesterification reaction?",
      "answer": "The catalytic activity of POST-1 is significantly reduced by partial N-methylation of the pyridyl groups exposed in the channels.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the effect of the amount of POST-1 catalyst on the rate of transesterification of 2 with ethanol?",
      "answer": "The rate of transesterification of 2 with ethanol increases with the amount of POST-1 catalyst used.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of the free pyridyl groups in POST-1 during the catalytic process?",
      "answer": "The free pyridyl groups exposed in the channels and also those exposed to the surface in POST-1 behave as catalytic centers.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"

    {
      "question": "Is the overall framework structure of POST-1 changed upon N-alkylation of the pyridyl groups exposed in the channels?",
      "answer": "No, the overall framework structure of POST-1 remains unchanged upon N-alkylation of the pyridyl groups exposed in the channels.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the effect of using different alcohols on the transesterification reaction catalyzed by POST-1?",
      "answer": "In the presence of POST-1 as the catalyst, transesterification of 2 with alcohols bulkier than ethanol occurs much more slowly or negligibly, indicating size selectivity of the catalyst.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the 'ghost plagioclase' trace-element signature in the context of recycled oceanic crust?",
      "answer": "The 'ghost plagioclase' trace-element signature demonstrates that the former gabbro can retain much of its original chemical identity through the convective cycle without completely mixing with other portions of the former oceanic crust.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What does the presence of I3- counterions in N-alkylated POST-1 indicate about the chemical modification process?",
      "answer": "The presence of I3- counterions in N-alkylated POST-1 indicates that the N-alkylation process involves the introduction of iodide ions as counterions, which can be further exchanged with other anions.",

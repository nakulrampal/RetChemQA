      "question": "What is the purpose of synthesizing 1,3,5-tris(5-methoxy-1,3-benzene dicarboxylic acid)benzene (L1)?",
      "answer": "The purpose of synthesizing L1 is to construct a flexible ligand that retains the optical properties of isophthalic acids (L2) for antenna effect and expands the molecular size for MOFs with large pore.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the pore size of MOFs affect the response to targets like PO43- and ATP?",
      "answer": "The pore size affects the response to targets by governing the accessibility of targets. Different diffusion dynamics are observed in MOFs with small pores for targets at different concentrations, and targets with large sizes can be directly blocked in MOFs with small pores.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of the –CH2-O- group in L1-Eu MOF?",
      "answer": "The –CH2-O- group in L1-Eu MOF tunes the energy transfer, allowing for dual-emission at 360 and 623 nm under single excitation of 290 nm, which facilitates ratiometric fluorescence sensing and visual detection.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the advantages of using a flexible ligand strategy in the synthesis of MOFs?",
      "answer": "The flexible ligand strategy is promising for expanding the aperture, improving optical properties, studying the response mechanism, and extending the applications of MOFs by integrating multiple functionalities and improving the structure of MOFs.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the relative specific surface area affect the linear response range in MOFs?",
      "answer": "The relative specific surface area affects the linear response range by enlarging the response range. MOFs with a larger relative specific surface area can provide a wider linear response range for targets.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"

    {
      "question": "True or False: L1-Eu MOF shows a dual-emission property that is utilized for ratiometric fluorescence sensing and visual detection.",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The synthesis of L1 involves connecting three isophthalic acids (L2) to a benzene ring without any flexible bonds.",
      "answer": "False",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the energy gap between the HOMO and LUMO of L1 and L2?",
      "answer": "The energy gap between the HOMO and LUMO of L1 and L2 is significant because it determines the efficiency of energy transfer for antenna effect emission. A smaller energy gap results in less energy required for electron transition, which is efficient for sensitizing Ln3+ ions.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the L1-Eu MOF respond to the presence of PO43- ions?",
      "answer": "L1-Eu MOF responds to the presence of PO43- ions by showing a change in fluorescence emission, where the emission at 360 nm enhances and that at 623 nm decreases slightly, indicating the interaction between Eu3+ ions and PO43- ions.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The synthesis of L1 does not involve any postsynthetic modification.",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"

    {
      "question": "What are the key properties that a competitive energetic material should possess according to the introduction section?",
      "answer": "A competitive energetic material should possess a high heat of formation and high density which give rise to good detonation properties. In addition, it should exhibit low sensitivities towards impact and friction and its thermal stability should exceed 200 °C.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the nucleus-independent chemical shift (NICS) and isochemical shielding surfaces (ICSS) analyses for compound 7?",
      "answer": "The NICS and ICSS analyses indicate that compound 7 has high aromaticity, with the two triazole rings being more aromatic than the tetrazine ring. This is consistent with the crystal structure of 7, where both triazole rings are more planar than the tetrazine ring.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the synthesis of compound 7 differ from the initial attempts, and what was the successful method?",
      "answer": "Initial attempts to synthesize compound 7 failed when 6-hydrazinyl-[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-b][1,2,4,5]tetrazin-3-amine was reacted with cyanogen bromide in HCl solution. The successful method involved reacting 3,6-dihydrazinyl-1,2,4,5-tetrazine with cyanogen bromide in ethanol, which yielded compound 7.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What are the detonation properties of compound 8 and how do they compare to RDX and HMX?",
      "answer": "Compound 8 exhibits better detonation velocities (vD, 9073 m s−1) and detonation pressures (P, 34.0 GPa) than RDX (vD, 8748 m s−1; P, 34.9 GPa), and comparable with those of HMX (vD, 9144 m s−1; P, 39.6 GPa).",

    {
      "question": "What role do π-π stacking and hydrogen bonds play in the properties of compounds 7-9?",
      "answer": "π-π stacking and hydrogen bonds observed in the crystal structures of compounds 7-9 contribute to enhancing their thermal stabilities and lowering sensitivities towards impact and friction.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"

    {
      "question": "True or False: The synthesis of compound 7 was initially successful when using hydrazine monohydrate in refluxing acetonitrile.",
      "answer": "False",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The aromaticity analyses suggest that the tetrazine ring in compound 7 is more aromatic than the triazole rings.",
      "answer": "False",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the impact sensitivity (IS) and friction sensitivity (FS) of compound 7, and how do they compare to traditional energetic materials?",
      "answer": "Compound 7 is insensitive towards impact and friction with IS and FS values greater than 40 J and 360 N, respectively, indicating that it has lower sensitivities compared to traditional energetic materials.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What computational methods were used to evaluate the aromaticity of compound 7?",
      "answer": "The nucleus-independent chemical shift (NICS) and isochemical shielding surfaces (ICSS) analyses were used to evaluate the aromaticity of compound 7.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The detonation properties of compound 8 are inferior to those of RDX.",

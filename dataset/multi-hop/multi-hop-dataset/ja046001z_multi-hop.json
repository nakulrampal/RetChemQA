    {
      "question": "Why do amines with three alkyl groups on the α-carbon or cationic amines not form helicates in aqueous solution?",
      "answer": "Steric encumbrance prevents the incorporation of amines with three alkyl groups on the α-carbon, and mutual repulsion between the positive charges of cationic amines and the cationic helicate backbone disfavors helicate formation.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does the use of acetonitrile as a solvent affect the selection rules for helicate self-assembly?",
      "answer": "Acetonitrile imposes a more restricted set of selection rules, excluding cationic and anionic amines from forming helicates due to solubility issues and poor hydrogen bond donation.",

    {
      "question": "What is the effect of the charge of the amine on the formation of dicopper double-helicate complexes?",
      "answer": "The charge of the amine affects its incorporation into the helicate structure, with positively charged amines being less likely to form helicates due to charge repulsion.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the solvent used in the reaction influence the formation of dicopper double-helicate complexes?",
      "answer": "The solvent influences the range of structures that can form and the selection rules for helicate self-assembly, with water allowing a broader range of structures compared to acetonitrile.",

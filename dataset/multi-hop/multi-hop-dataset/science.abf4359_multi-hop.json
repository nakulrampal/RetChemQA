    {
      "question": "What was the significance of using different counterions (e.g., Cs+, Na+, Li+) in the coupling reaction of phosphoramidite and nucleoside phosphonate salt?",
      "answer": "Using different counterions in the coupling reaction was significant because it helped to suppress the background autocatalysis promoted by the triethylammonium cation, thereby enabling the chiral catalysts to exert their stereocontrol more effectively and achieve higher selectivity in the synthesis of the dinucleotide products.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the impact of the research on the field of oligonucleotide synthesis?",
      "answer": "The research impacts the field of oligonucleotide synthesis by providing a new catalytic approach to the synthesis of P-stereogenic nucleotide derivatives, enabling the stereocontrolled synthesis of dinucleotides and cyclic dinucleotides without the need for stoichiometric activators or chiral auxiliaries, thus offering a more efficient and selective method for producing these biologically significant compounds.",

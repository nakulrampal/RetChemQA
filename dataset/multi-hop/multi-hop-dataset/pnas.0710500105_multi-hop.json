      "question": "What is the role of silver hexafluoroantimonate in the synthesis of cationic phosphinegold(I) complex 1?",
      "answer": "Silver hexafluoroantimonate is used to abstract the chloride from the phosphinegold(I) chloride complex, converting it into cationic phosphinegold(I) complex 1.",

      "answer": "Complexes 1 and 4 are active in typical gold(I)-catalyzed reactions because they are cationic phosphinegold(I) complexes, which are superior (cid:1)-activation catalysts compared to their Cu(I) and Ag(I) counterparts.",

    {
      "question": "How does the bonding model explain the activation of (cid:1)-bonds by cationic gold(I) complexes?",
      "answer": "The Dewar–Chatt–Duncanson bonding model explains the activation of (cid:1)-bonds by cationic gold(I) complexes through increased (cid:1)-to-metal (cid:3)-donation to gold and/or decreased metal-to-(cid:1)* back-donation from gold.",

    {
      "question": "Why were complexes 1-4 difficult to isolate and characterize initially?",
      "answer": "Complexes 1-4 were difficult to isolate and characterize initially due to the traditionally challenging nature of isolating Au(I)-(cid:1)-complexes and the kinetically labile nature of alkenes and alkynes.",

    {
      "question": "How does the structure of the Cu(I)-bound alkyne in complex 3 compare to the Au(I)- and Ag(I)-bound alkynes in terms of symmetry and geometry?",
      "answer": "The Cu(I)-bound alkyne in complex 3 is highly symmetrical and exhibits pseudo-trigonal planar geometry, unlike the Au(I)- and Ag(I)-bound alkynes in complexes 1 and 2, which are significantly 'slipped' to one side of the (cid:1)-bond.",

      "question": "What was the role of silver chloride precipitation in the synthesis of cationic phosphinegold(I) complex 1?",
      "answer": "Silver chloride precipitation occurred during the synthesis of cationic phosphinegold(I) complex 1 as a result of chloride abstraction by silver hexafluoroantimonate, indicating the formation of the cationic complex.",

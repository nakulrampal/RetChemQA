      "question": "What unique property does the compound [FeII(prentrz)2PdII(CN)4] exhibit according to the study?",
      "answer": "The compound exhibits an atypical pore transformation that involves simultaneous pore opening and closing caused by the non-uniform pedal motion of the prentrz ligands and the crumpling/unfolding of the layer structure in response to the adsorption of guest water molecules.",

      "question": "How does the structural transformation of [FeII(prentrz)2PdII(CN)4] affect its spin-crossover (SCO) properties?",
      "answer": "The structural transformation of the magnetic framework shifts the SCO properties of the FeII magnetic centers, resulting in a variation in the spin-crossover property, with a two-step SCO with a large plateau for the lcp phase and a two-step SCO with no plateau for the nqp phase.",

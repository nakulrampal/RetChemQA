          "question": "How does the introduction of fluorine atoms into the pore surfaces of MOFs affect their gas adsorption and separation performances?",
          "answer": "The introduction of fluorine atoms into the pore surfaces of MOFs enhances the separation performances toward alkyne/alkene mixtures by providing polarizable adsorption sites and tailored pore sizes, leading to an increase in C2H2 selectivity in C2H2/C2H4 and C3H4 selectivity in C3H4/C3H6 separations.",

          "question": "What was the main challenge in designing MOF adsorbents for light hydrocarbon separations according to the study?",
          "answer": "The main challenge was the complexity in the separation processes and the relative lack of structure-separation relationship information, making it difficult to design MOF adsorbents rationally according to industrial demands.",

          "question": "What role do polar F sites within the confined pores of Cu-FINA-1 and Cu-FINA-2 play in gas adsorption?",
          "answer": "The polar F sites within the confined pores of Cu-FINA-1 and Cu-FINA-2 interact with gas adsorbates through C-H···F hydrogen bonds, contributing to the enhanced separation selectivity.",

          "question": "True or False: The study concludes that the enhancement of separation selectivities in fluorinated MOFs is mainly attributed to the optimization of pore size and roughness of the diffusion path.",

    {
      "question": "What was the observed effect on the MOF's structure and fluorescence emission spectra upon increasing pressure to 2.1 GPa?",
      "answer": "The MOF undergoes a reversible phase transition where the ligand conformation changes from coplanar to twisted, resulting in a shift in the UV/Vis absorption and fluorescence emission spectra.",

    {
      "question": "What does the increase in the population of the twisted conformer indicate about the MOF's framework under pressure?",
      "answer": "A decrease in population of the planar conformer gives rise to a less rigid and more flexible framework, potentially increasing the pore volume.",

      "question": "What is the relationship between the pressure-induced spectral shifts and the MOF's structure?",
      "answer": "The spectral shifts are not caused by the pressure-induced shift in excitation energy of a single emitting species but by the interconversion of two spectroscopically distinct ground-state species whose emission spectra are essentially independent of pressure.",

    {
      "question": "How does the MOF's response to pressure compare to other MOFs like ZIF-8 and UiO-abdc(Zr)?",
      "answer": "Similar to ZIF-8 and UiO-abdc(Zr), the Hf-peb MOF shows changes in pore volume and content under pressure, but the mechanism involving an increase in population of a less favorable conformer under ambient conditions is new.",

    {
      "question": "How does the flexibility of the MOF framework influence its photoluminescence properties?",
      "answer": "The flexibility allows the MOF structure to respond to changes in the electronic structure of the ligand upon excitation, influencing the photoluminescence properties.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What does the study reveal about the photophysics of the linkers within the MOF?",

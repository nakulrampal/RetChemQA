      "question": "What is the impact of replacing one of the two ligands in CPM-2-NH2 on the framework composition?",
      "answer": "Replacing either one of the two ligands in CPM-2-NH2 allows for tuning the framework composition, leading to phases with different functional groups oriented towards the pore center of 12-ring channels, which can lead to different interactions with guest molecules.",

      "question": "What are the structural differences between CPM-8 and CPM-9, and how are these differences achieved?",
      "answer": "The structural differences between CPM-8 and CPM-9 are primarily in their dimensions, which are achieved by using different linear dicarboxylates (bpdc or 1,4-ndc) for cross-linking three-rings, resulting in size-tunable cage structures.",

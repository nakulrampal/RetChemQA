      "question": "What evidence supports the conclusion that the isomerization reaction took place inside the pores of the coordination network?",
      "answer": "Evidence supporting the conclusion includes the direct extraction of isomerized retinal from the crystals, the rapid exchange of in-retinal with out-retinal, and the absence of catalytic activity in a similar complex with no absorption property for retinal.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What was the effect of changing the solvent to t-BuOH on the isomerization reaction?",
      "answer": "Changing the solvent to t-BuOH reduced the guest exchange rate, indicating that the reaction occurred only within the network pores as the retinal prefers the more hydrophobic domain within the pores.",

    {
      "question": "How does the presence of electron-deficient TPT ligands contribute to the structure and function of the porous network?",
      "answer": "The electron-deficient TPT ligands contribute to the structure by coordinating with ZnI2 to form large pores, and they potentially enhance the host−guest electronic interaction, facilitating organic transformations like retinal isomerization.",

    },
    {
      "question": "Why was the experiment conducted under an Ar atmosphere and in the dark?",
      "answer": "The experiment was conducted under an Ar atmosphere and in the dark to prevent photoisomerization of retinal, ensuring that any observed isomerization was catalyzed by the porous network.",

    {
      "question": "What role does the ZnI2 component play in the porous coordination network?",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the structure of the coordination network facilitate the diffusion of retinal into its pores?",
      "answer": "The large pores of the network, bounded by electron-deficient coordinated TPT ligands, facilitate the rapid diffusion of retinal into the crystal pores.",

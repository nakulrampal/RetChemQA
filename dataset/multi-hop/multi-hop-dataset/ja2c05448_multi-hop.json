      "question": "What are the synthesis conditions for ZUL-C1?",
      "answer": "A mixture of AlCl3⋅6H2O (0.089 g, 0.37 mmol), H2bpdc (0.061 g, 0.39 mmol) and DMF (2.75 ml) was stirred at 433K for 24 hours, yielding white powder (64 mg; 88.3%). The product was washed with 10 ml DMF and 10 ml methanol for three times each, then dried and degassed under high vacuum (< 10 µmHg) at 393 K for 24 h before use.",

      "question": "How does the synthesis of ZUL-C2 differ from ZUL-C1?",
      "answer": "For ZUL-C2, H2cdc (0.075 g, 0.39 mmol) is used instead of H2bpdc, with the rest of the synthesis conditions remaining the same as for ZUL-C1. This results in a white powder yield of 79 mg (91.2%).",

      "question": "What is the role of DMF in the synthesis of ZUL-C1 and ZUL-C2?",
      "answer": "DMF acts as a solvent in the synthesis of ZUL-C1 and ZUL-C2, facilitating the reaction between AlCl3⋅6H2O and the respective dicarboxylic acid ligands (H2bpdc for ZUL-C1 and H2cdc for ZUL-C2) at elevated temperatures.",

      "question": "What is the significance of using different dicarboxylic acid ligands (H2bpdc for ZUL-C1 and H2cdc for ZUL-C2) in the synthesis?",
      "answer": "The use of different dicarboxylic acid ligands affects the pore environment and structure of the resulting MOFs, ZUL-C1 and ZUL-C2, which in turn influences their gas adsorption and separation properties.",

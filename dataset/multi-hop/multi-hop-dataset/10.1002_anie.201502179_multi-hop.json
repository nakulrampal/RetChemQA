    },
    {
      "question": "What transformation occurs to the bpeb ligands under UV light before the [2++2] cycloaddition reaction?",
      "answer": "The bpeb ligands undergo pedal motion from trans,trans,trans-conformation to trans,cis,trans-conformation.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of guest water molecules in the channels of the MOF?",
      "answer": "The presence of water in the channels promotes pedal motion and hence the photoreactivity of the MOF.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the presence of different solvents in the MOF channels affect its photoluminescent properties?",
      "answer": "The presence of different solvents in the MOF channels results in varied solid-state emissive properties, showing different lmax when excited at 360 nm.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens to the organic polymer in the MOF upon heating?",
      "answer": "The organic polymer in the MOF can be depolymerized reversibly by cleaving the cyclobutane rings upon heating.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the pedal motion in the formation of the syndiotactic polymer ligand?",
      "answer": "The pedal motion brings the olefin bonds in the bpeb ligands closer together, facilitating the [2++2] cycloaddition reaction to form the syndiotactic polymer ligand.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the effect of exchanging guest solvents in the MOF with methanol?",
      "answer": "Exchanging guest solvents with methanol results in the formation of a different MOF structure that is photo-inactive due to the separation of olefin bonds in bpeb ligands.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why are the crystals of MOF 3 photoreactive while MOF 2 is not?",
      "answer": "MOF 3 is photoreactive because water in the channel promotes pedal motion, whereas MOF 2, obtained by exchanging with methanol, lacks this pedal motion due to the absence of water.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the presence of guest molecules in the MOF channels influence its photoreactivity?",
      "answer": "The presence of guest molecules like water promotes pedal motion and photoreactivity, while other solvents like methanol or DMF may hinder photoreactivity.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What structural change occurs in the MOF upon UV irradiation?",
      "answer": "Upon UV irradiation, the MOF undergoes a single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformation, integrating a syndiotactic organic polymer ligand into its structure.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the MOF structure facilitate the [2++2] cycloaddition reaction?",
      "answer": "The MOF structure facilitates the [2++2] cycloaddition reaction through pedal motion of the bpeb ligands, bringing the olefin bonds closer for the reaction.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the outcome of heating the MOF containing the syndiotactic polymer ligand?",
      "answer": "Heating the MOF containing the syndiotactic polymer ligand results in depolymerization, cleaving the cyclobutane rings and potentially reverting to the original ligand structure.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the syndiotactic polymer ligand formation reversible?",
      "answer": "Yes, the formation of the syndiotactic polymer ligand is reversible through heating, which cleaves the cyclobutane rings.",

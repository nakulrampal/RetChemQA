      "question": "What are the three distinct phases observed in the study of X-pcu-3-Zn-3i?",
      "answer": "The three distinct phases observed are the as-synthesized α phase, a denser-activated β phase, and a shape-memory γ phase.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the density of X-pcu-3-Zn-3i-α compare to X-pcu-3-Zn-3i-β?",
      "answer": "X-pcu-3-Zn-3i-α has a lower density (1.046 g/cm3) compared to X-pcu-3-Zn-3i-β (1.333 g/cm3).",

    {
      "question": "What triggers the transformation from X-pcu-3-Zn-3i-β to X-pcu-3-Zn-3i-γ?",
      "answer": "The transformation is triggered by gas adsorption, specifically by CO2 at 195 K, N2 at 77 K, and CO at 82 K.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the shape-memory phase X-pcu-3-Zn-3i-γ reversible, and if so, how can it be reverted to its original phase?",
      "answer": "Yes, X-pcu-3-Zn-3i-γ is reversible and can revert to the β phase when heated at >400 K under vacuum or to the α phase by soaking in DMF.",

    {
      "question": "What role does interpenetration play in the stability of the shape-memory phase of X-pcu-3-Zn-3i?",

      "question": "What experimental techniques were used to study the phase transformations in X-pcu-3-Zn-3i?",
      "answer": "Single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD), gas sorption, in situ variable temperature/pressure powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), and molecular modeling were used.",

      "question": "How does the guest accessible volume change from X-pcu-3-Zn-3i-α to X-pcu-3-Zn-3i-β?",
      "answer": "The guest accessible volume decreases from 46% in X-pcu-3-Zn-3i-α to 15% in X-pcu-3-Zn-3i-β.",

    {
      "question": "What is the role of the extended ligands (X ligands) in the flexibility of X-pcu-3-Zn-3i?",
      "answer": "Extended ligands (X ligands) can distort more readily than shorter ligands, contributing to the framework's flexibility and enabling the shape-memory effect.",

    {
      "question": "True or False: X-pcu-3-Zn-3i exhibits a shape-memory effect under the influence of multiple sorbates.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What factors are expected to facilitate a kinetically stable shape-memory FMOM according to the study?",
      "answer": "Framework flexibility induced by sorbent-sorbate interactions, interpenetration enabling framework-framework interactions, and reduced strain in the MBBs and linkers in the shape-memory phase.",

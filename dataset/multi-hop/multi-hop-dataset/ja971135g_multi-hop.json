          "question": "What are the synthesis conditions for 2,3‘-Dicyanodiphenylacetylene (2,3‘-DCPA, 1)?",
          "answer": "2,3‘-Dicyanodiphenylacetylene (2,3‘-DCPA, 1) was prepared by a three-step sequence involving palladium-catalyzed cross coupling of (trimethylsilyl)acetylene with 2-bromobenzonitrile to afford trimethylsilyl-protected 2-ethynylbenzonitrile (9) in high yield. Deprotection to the terminal acetylene was performed with K2CO3 in MeOH and CH2Cl2, and the product was not isolated. The formation of 2,3‘-DCPA was achieved in good yield via palladium-catalyzed cross coupling of the terminal acetylene with 3-bromobenzonitrile.",

          "question": "How does the substitution pattern of nitrile groups on diphenylacetylene influence the topology of structures formed with silver(I) salts?",
          "answer": "The topology of the structures formed with silver(I) salts depends on the substitution pattern of nitrile groups on diphenylacetylene. For 2,3‘-DCPA (1), cyclic dimers are produced, whereas crystallization of 2,2‘-DCPA (2) yields an infinite chain structure, and 2,4‘-DCPA (3) results in an infinite, undulating sheet structure.",

          "question": "What is the role of acetone and acetonitrile in the aggregation of 2,3‘-DCPA with silver(I) salts according to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) data?",
          "answer": "According to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) data, acetone allows for significant aggregation of 2,3‘-DCPA with silver(I) salts even at millimolar concentrations, while acetonitrile disrupts this aggregation due to its competitive coordination to silver(I).",

          "answer": "The cyclic dimer [Ag2(1)2(CF3SO3)]+ observed in ESI-MS for solutions of 2,3‘-DCPA and AgCF3SO3 is significant because it corresponds to the cyclic dimer motif observed in the solid-state structures of complexes 4−6, minus one counterion. This suggests the formation of similar cyclic dimers in solution.",

          "answer": "The aggregate [Ag2(1)2(CF3SO3)]+ is more abundant in acetone compared to acetonitrile for solutions of 2,3‘-DCPA and AgCF3SO3, as acetonitrile's competitive coordination to silver(I) limits aggregation.",

    {
      "question": "Why does compound 1 undergo a transformation into compound 3 in the presence of water?",
      "answer": "Compound 1 undergoes a transformation into compound 3 in the presence of water due to the hydrophobic outer surface and less hydrophobic inner surface of the MOP cages, which unfold into a MOF upon interaction with water.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does the presence of propargyloxy functionality affect the interconversion of MOPs in water?",

    {
      "question": "What is the role of the terminal moieties in the self-assembly process of forming compound 3?",

      "question": "Is the conversion of MOP crystals into MOF crystals a simple recrystallization phenomenon?",
      "answer": "False, the conversion of MOP crystals into MOF crystals in the presence of water is not a simple recrystallization phenomenon but involves breaking, rearrangement, and reformation of labile metal–oxygen bonds.",

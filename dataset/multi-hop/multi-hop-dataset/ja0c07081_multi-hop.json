    {
      "question": "What is the role of acetic acid in the synthesis of Y-hpt-MOF-1?",
      "answer": "Acetic acid is crucial in obtaining a high-quality crystalline material because using only 2-FBA resulted in Y-hpt-MOF-1 with low crystallinity and not in a single crystal form.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },

      "question": "How does the presence of sulfone groups in Zr-flu-SO2 and Hf-flu-SO2 affect their CO2 adsorption properties compared to PCN-521?",
      "answer": "The presence of sulfone groups in Zr-flu-SO2 and Hf-flu-SO2 greatly enhances the CO2 uptake compared to PCN-521 due to increased interaction with polar gases like CO2.",

    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the disorder observed in the structure of Y-ken-MOF-1?",
      "answer": "The disorder observed in Y-ken-MOF-1, including the nonanuclear [Y9(μ3-Ο)2(μ3-ΟΗ)12(OH)2(H2O)11]8+ cluster being statistically disordered over two positions, imposes disorder on the organic linker and affects the overall structure and potentially the properties of the MOF.",

    {
      "question": "What is the highest BET surface area reported among the RE-based MOFs mentioned, and which material does it correspond to?",
      "answer": "The highest BET surface area reported is 3690 m2 g-1, corresponding to Y-ftw-MOF-2.",

    {
      "question": "True or False: The synthesis of Y-hpt-MOF-1 requires the use of 2-fluorobenzoic acid (2-FBA) as the only modulator.",
      "answer": "False. The synthesis of Y-hpt-MOF-1 requires a mixed modulator system using both acetic acid and 2-FBA for high-quality crystalline material.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"

    {
      "question": "True or False: The thermal stability of Zr-flu-SO2 is confirmed by its TGA curve showing stability up to 450 °C.",
      "answer": "True. The TGA curve for Zr-flu-SO2 shows that the material is stable up to 450 °C.",

      "question": "What is the role of solvent polarity in the formation of G-quadruplexes?",
      "answer": "Solvent polarity affects the size of the G-quadruplexes formed; more polar solvents favor the formation of larger assemblies because they can solvate the dissociated anion more efficiently, thus reducing the destabilizing force and allowing for the growth of larger aggregates.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does the presence of specific anions influence the self-assembly of guanosine derivatives into G-quadruplexes?",
      "answer": "Specific anions play a subtle role in the self-assembly process; less-coordinating anions shift the equilibrium towards the formation of the quadruplex, with non-coordinating anions like PF6- favoring the growth of the G-quadruplexes.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the cation–anion distance in the formation of G-quadruplexes?",
      "answer": "The cation–anion distance is significant because it directly influences the Coulombic energy associated with the separation of ion pairs, which in turn affects the stability and size of the G-quadruplexes formed.",

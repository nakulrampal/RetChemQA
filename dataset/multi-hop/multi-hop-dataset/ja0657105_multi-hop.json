      "answer": "The synthesis conditions for the formation of [Tl(OEt2)3][H2N{B(C6F5)3}2] (2a) involve the addition of compound 1 to a solution of TlOEt in diethyl ether, followed by stirring overnight. The volatiles are then removed under vacuum to yield a sticky foam, which is washed repeatedly with light petroleum to give a fine white powder.",

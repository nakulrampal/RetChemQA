    },
    {
      "question": "Why was a class of low symmetry nets known as nonregular nets chosen for constructing the MOF?",
      "answer": "Nonregular nets were chosen because they allow for the construction of a 2D MOF with two different cavities, which is difficult to achieve with nets of higher symmetry.",

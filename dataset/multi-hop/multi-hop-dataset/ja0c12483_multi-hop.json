      "question": "What is the purpose of using a Fourier difference map in the Rietveld refinement process for ND3@UiO-67 and ND3@UiO-bpydc samples?",
      "answer": "The purpose of using a Fourier difference map in the Rietveld refinement process for ND3@UiO-67 and ND3@UiO-bpydc samples is to determine the possible locations of ND3 molecules inside the MOF cavities. This method helps in identifying the specific sites within the framework where ND3 molecules are adsorbed, which is crucial for understanding the host-guest interactions and the structural changes upon gas adsorption.",

      "question": "How does the adsorption of NH3 affect the rotational energy barriers (Erb) of the MOF linkers in UiO-67 and UiO-bpydc?",
      "answer": "The adsorption of NH3 significantly affects the rotational energy barriers (Erb) of the MOF linkers in UiO-67 and UiO-bpydc. For UiO-bpydc, the adsorption of NH3 dramatically increases the Erb, indicating a reduction in the flexibility of the linkers due to stronger host-guest interactions, particularly through hydrogen bonding. This change is less pronounced in UiO-67, suggesting that the nature of the linker and the type of interaction with NH3 play a crucial role in modulating the flexibility of the MOF structure.",

      "question": "What experimental technique is used to study the dynamic interactions between stored NH3 and the host structures of UiO-67 and UiO-bpydc, and what does it reveal?",
      "answer": "Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) is the experimental technique used to study the dynamic interactions between stored NH3 and the host structures of UiO-67 and UiO-bpydc. The INS spectra reveal considerable changes in the vibrational modes of the NH3-loaded samples, suggesting specific interactions between NH3 and the MOF due to gas adsorption at different binding sites. The technique provides insights into the suppression and stiffening of lattice motions, such as linker rotation, and the formation of hydrogen bonding and supramolecular interactions with the adsorbed NH3.",

      "question": "What role does the healing process play in the adsorption behavior of UiO-67 and UiO-bpydc towards NH3?",
      "answer": "The healing process plays a significant role in modifying the adsorption behavior of UiO-67 and UiO-bpydc towards NH3. For UiO-67, the healing process, which involves ligand exchange, leads to the disappearance of the second transition step in the NH3 adsorption isotherm, indicating the repair of missing linker defects. For UiO-bpydc, the healing process results in an increase in NH3 uptake capacity without significantly changing the transition pressure, suggesting that more bipyridine linkers are available for binding NH3 after healing. This process effectively alters the pore structure and the availability of binding sites within the MOFs.",

      "question": "How does the incorporation of NH3 molecules inside UiO-67 and UiO-bpydc MOFs affect their structural and dynamic properties according to neutron diffraction and INS studies?",
      "answer": "The incorporation of NH3 molecules inside UiO-67 and UiO-bpydc MOFs significantly affects their structural and dynamic properties. Neutron diffraction studies reveal changes in the framework structure, such as linker rotation and the formation of new binding sites for NH3. INS studies show alterations in vibrational modes, indicating specific host-guest interactions and the suppression of lattice motions like linker rotation. These changes suggest that NH3 adsorption leads to a reduction in the flexibility of the MOFs, with stronger host-guest interactions in UiO-bpydc due to hydrogen bonding. Overall, NH3 incorporation modulates the MOFs' structural dynamics, affecting their gas adsorption and storage capabilities.",

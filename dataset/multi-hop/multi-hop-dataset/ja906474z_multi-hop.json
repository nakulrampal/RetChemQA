      "question": "What method was used for the X-ray structure determination of host 1?",
      "answer": "X-ray intensity data were measured using a Bruker SMART APEX diffractometer with Mo Kα radiation, and the structure was solved using direct methods, difference Fourier calculations, and full-matrix least-squares refinement against F2 with SHELXTL.",

      "question": "What were the conditions under which the X-ray structure of the 1·Cd2+ complex was determined?",
      "answer": "The X-ray structure of the 1·Cd2+ complex was determined at 150K on a D8 goniostat equipped with a Bruker APEXII CCD detector at Beamline 11.3.1 at the Advanced Light Source using synchrotron radiation tuned to λ=0.7749Å.",

    {
      "question": "What challenges were encountered during the refinement of the 2·Ag+ complex structure?",
      "answer": "Refinement of the 2·Ag+ complex structure was hampered by heavy disorder of the triflate anions and solvent molecules, which were badly disordered and could not be modeled successfully.",

    {
      "question": "How was the disorder of the guest species in the 2·Ag+ complex addressed during the structure refinement?",
      "answer": "The disorder of the guest species in the 2·Ag+ complex was addressed by removing their contribution to the structure factors with the Squeeze program in PLATON.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What was the approach taken to model the tert-butyl group and guest solvent regions in the host 2 compound?",
      "answer": "The tert-butyl group was modeled with two orientations in a fixed ratio, and one of the guest solvent regions was modeled as a methylene chloride molecule disordered over three positions. The other guest solvent region was more difficult to model and was refined as two methylene chloride molecules and one methanol molecule with manually chosen populations.",

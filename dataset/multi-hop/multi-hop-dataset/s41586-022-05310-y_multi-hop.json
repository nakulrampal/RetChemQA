      "question": "What are the key components used in the synthesis of the porous coordination polymers (PCPs) for water isotopologue separation?",
      "answer": "The key components used in the synthesis of the PCPs for water isotopologue separation are Cu-based PCP with a dragonfly-type ligand comprising isophthalic acid and dibenzo[b,f]azepine (DBAP) moieties or 2,2'-iminodibenzyl (IDB) moieties.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How do the dynamic frameworks of the PCPs contribute to the separation of water isotopologues?",
      "answer": "The dynamic frameworks of the PCPs contribute to the separation of water isotopologues by encoding dynamic flip-flop molecular motions into a diffusion-regulatory gate functionality, which regulates the diffusion of water isotopologues and amplifies their rate differences.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of temperature in the adsorption process of water isotopologues by the PCPs?",
      "answer": "Temperature plays a significant role in the adsorption process by inducing thermal flipping of the gate moieties in the PCPs, which facilitates the admission of water isotopologues at high temperatures and blocks them at low temperatures, thereby regulating the diffusion rates.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What experimental technique was used to confirm the presence and ratio of the coordinating DMA and ligands in the PCPs?",
      "answer": "1H NMR measurements were used to confirm the presence and ratio of the coordinating DMA and ligands in the PCPs.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the synthesis method of the PCPs ensure the removal of water molecules for activation?",
      "answer": "The synthesis method ensures the removal of water molecules for activation by exchanging the guest and coordination solvents with methanol, followed by direct evacuation of the PCPs at 393 K to remove the water molecules and produce the activated phases.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the calculated energy barriers for H2O and D2O diffusions in the PCPs?",
      "answer": "The calculated energy barriers for H2O and D2O diffusions in the PCPs are significant because they provide insight into the difficulty of H2O or D2O to freely enter or leave the pores of the PCPs during adsorption, and they help elucidate the difference in their diffusion behavior.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How do the PCPs achieve selective adsorption of H2O over D2O?",
      "answer": "The PCPs achieve selective adsorption of H2O over D2O by utilizing a diffusion-regulatory mechanism that amplifies the slight differences in the diffusion rates of water isotopologues, facilitated by the dynamic nature of the PCPs' frameworks.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What experimental evidence supports the stability of the PCPs upon activation and water isotopologue sorption?",
      "answer": "The stability of the PCPs upon activation and water isotopologue sorption is supported by microscopy images showing that FDC–1a and FDC–2a retained their crystal shapes after activation and long-term measurements.",

      "type": "reasoning"

      "question": "True or False: The synthesis of the PCPs involves the use of a dragonfly-type ligand comprising isophthalic acid and either dibenzo[b,f]azepine (DBAP) or 2,2'-iminodibenzyl (IDB) moieties.",

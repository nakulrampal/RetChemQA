      "question": "What is the primary advantage of using 3D printed reactionware for hydrothermal synthesis as demonstrated in the text?",
      "answer": "The primary advantage is the ability to perform multi-step hydrothermal synthesis by creating reactors with internal geometries that allow compartmentalization of different reaction mixtures, enabling the synthesis of materials unavailable by traditional one-pot methods.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the introduction of separate compartments in the reactor influence the synthesis process?",

    {
      "question": "What is the main limitation of traditional hydrothermal synthesis methods compared to the 3D printed reactionware approach?",
      "answer": "Traditional hydrothermal synthesis methods are usually carried out under one-pot, single-step conditions, which precludes the exploration of multi-step reactions or more complex reaction conditions, limiting the ability to introduce synthetic complexity.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the digital control of hydrothermal synthesis contribute to the field of material science?",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why are POMOFs 1 to 3 significant in the context of the study?",
      "answer": "POMOFs 1 to 3 are significant because they were prepared using a multi-stage hydrothermal reaction in a 3D printed compartmentalized reactor and were unable to be produced by conventional one-pot apparatus, demonstrating the capability of the new approach.",
      "difficulty": "medium",

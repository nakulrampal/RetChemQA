    },
    {
      "question": "Why were initial attempts to use sulfates as bridging ligands in PCN-9 unsuccessful?",
      "answer": "Due to the limited coordination number of the cobalt center and the need for additional counterions to balance the overall charge.",

      "question": "What is the pore size of PCN-17, and how does it affect its gas-adsorption selectivity?",
      "answer": "Around 3.5 D, resulting in the selective adsorption of O2 over N2, H2 over CO, and H2 over N2.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What was the outcome of trying to use volatile solvents for activating PCN-17, and why?",
      "answer": "The solvent-exchanged sample did not adsorb either N2 or H2 due to the small pore sizes preventing the entrance of methanol or dichloromethane.",
      "difficulty": "Hard",
      "type": "Reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why was ytterbium chosen over cobalt for the synthesis of PCN-17?",
      "answer": "Because the coordination number of the metal center can be increased using Ln3+ cations like ytterbium instead of Co2+, and no additional counterions are needed to balance the overall charge.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does the presence of sulfate bridging ligands affect the pore size in PCN-17?",
      "answer": "The sulfate bridging ligands reduce the pore size to around 3.5 D, affecting the gas-adsorption selectivity.",

      "type": "Reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What was the method used for successful activation of PCN-17, and why was it necessary?",
      "answer": "Evacuating a fresh PCN-17 sample at 250 8C overnight under a dynamic vacuum was used for successful activation because small pores prevented solvent exchange with volatile solvents.",

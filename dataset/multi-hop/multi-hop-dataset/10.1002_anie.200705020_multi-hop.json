    },
    {
      "question": "Why are mesoporous coordination polymers more rare than microporous ones?",
      "answer": "Mesoporous coordination polymers are more rare because as the size of the organic linker increases, the structural integrity of the resulting coordination polymer decreases, which can result in collapse of the pore structure and a loss of crystallinity.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of probabilistic analysis in the synthesis of UMCM-1?",

    {
      "question": "How does the presence of mesopores in UMCM-1 affect its surface area?",

      "question": "What is the significance of the observed isotope shift in potassium hydrogen (±)-α,α′-di-tert-butylsuccinate-18O in various solvents?",
      "answer": "The observed isotope shift being larger than the intrinsic isotope shift measured in the diacid indicates that hydrogen (±)-α,α′-di-tert-butylsuccinate monoanion exists as a pair of interconverting tautomers rather than as a single symmetric structure.",

    },
    {
      "question": "Why can the short O−O distance in hydrogen (±)-α,α′-di-tert-butylsuccinate monoanion not be used as evidence for a strong hydrogen bond?",
      "answer": "The same short O−O distance is seen in the cesium salt of the dianion, which cannot have a stabilizing hydrogen bond, suggesting that this short distance is an inescapable feature of the conformation of many α,α′-di-tert-butylsuccinate anions and not indicative of a strong hydrogen bond.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What does the asymmetry of the hydrogen bond in hydrogen (±)-α,α′-di-tert-butylsuccinate monoanion indicate about its stabilization?",
      "answer": "The asymmetry indicates that there is no special stabilization associated with symmetric hydrogen bonds, and the large ΔpKa in (±)-α,α′-di-tert-butylsuccinic acid is not due to any feature of the hydrogen bond itself but is attributed to the electrostatic repulsion between the carboxylates in the dianion.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How was the mono-18O-labeled (±)-α,α′-di-tert-butylsuccinic acid synthesized?",
      "answer": "The mono-18O-labeled (±)-α,α′-di-tert-butylsuccinic acid was synthesized by hydrolysis of its anhydride with Na18OH in H218O, followed by acidification.",

      "type": "factual"

    {
      "question": "What method was used to investigate the symmetry of the hydrogen bonds in the monoanions of 1,2-dicarboxylic acids?",
      "answer": "The method of isotopic perturbation of equilibrium was used, which depends on the measurement of the isotope shift due to an isotope atoms distant from the reporter nucleus.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The large ΔpKa difference in (±)-α,α′-di-tert-butylsuccinic acid is due to the strong hydrogen bond in its monoanion.",
      "answer": "False",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The monoanion of (±)-α,α′-di-tert-butylsuccinate exists as a single symmetric species in solution.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What does the variation of isotope shift with solvent in potassium hydrogen (±)-α,α′-di-tert-butylsuccinate-18O indicate?",
      "answer": "The variation of isotope shift with solvent should not be taken as evidence for any variations in symmetry of the hydrogen bond, but probably due to variations of chemical shifts that are not independently measurable except in diacid or dianion.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The presence of tert-butyl groups in α,α′-di-tert-butylsuccinic acid derivatives guarantees steric strain.",

      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of resonance in stabilizing hydrogen bonds in hydrogen (±)-α,α′-di-tert-butylsuccinate monoanion?",
      "answer": "The asymmetry of the hydrogen bond means that the two resonance forms are not identical, and its hydrogen bond does not benefit from a maximum resonance stabilization, indicating that resonance does not play a significant role in stabilizing the hydrogen bond.",

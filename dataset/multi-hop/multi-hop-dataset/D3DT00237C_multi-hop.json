      "question": "What is the coordination environment around the Pb(II) center in SM-3?",
      "answer": "The Pb(II) ion is eight coordinated by three O-atoms of two bdc2- ligands, three O-atoms of two nitrate ions, and two N-atoms of py-Phen ligand, representing a distorted square antiprismatic geometry.",

    {
      "question": "How does the presence of free –N donor sites and π-electron-rich rings in SM-3 contribute to its adsorption performance?",
      "answer": "The presence of free –N donor sites and π-electron-rich rings in SM-3 contribute to its excellent adsorption performance by providing recognition sites for interactions with analytes like iodine and dyes, enhancing the adsorption process.",

    {
      "question": "Is the adsorption of iodine by SM-3 in the vapor phase a chemisorption process?",
      "answer": "True. The adsorption of iodine by SM-3 in the vapor phase is a chemisorption process, as indicated by the TGA analysis showing that I2-loaded SM-3 crystals start to decompose at a higher temperature than the pristine MOF due to the strong interaction between iodine molecules and the adsorbent.",

    {
      "question": "What role do the dinuclear SBUs [Pb2(COO)2]2- play in the structure of SM-3?",
      "answer": "The dinuclear SBUs [Pb2(COO)2]2- in SM-3 play a crucial role in forming the framework by bridging Pb atoms through oxygen of bdc2- and nitrate ions, resulting in the formation of a 1D zig-zag chain which is further expanded to construct an infinite 2D framework.",

    {
      "question": "How does the Langmuir isotherm model compare to the Freundlich isotherm model in describing the iodine adsorption process by SM-3?",
      "answer": "The Langmuir isotherm model describes the iodine adsorption process by SM-3 better than the Freundlich isotherm model, as indicated by a higher R2 value for the Langmuir model, suggesting that monolayer iodine adsorption occurs on homogeneously distributed active adsorption sites on the surface of SM-3.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Does SM-3 exhibit selective adsorption performance towards cationic dyes from aqueous solution?",
      "answer": "True. SM-3 exhibits selective adsorption performance towards hazardous cationic dyes, namely, methylene blue (MB) and rhodamine-B (Rh-B), from aqueous solution, due to its unique structure and interaction mechanisms.",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"

    {
      "question": "What is the maximum iodine uptake amount by SM-3 in the vapor phase?",
      "answer": "The maximum iodine uptake amount by SM-3 in the vapor phase is 157.5 mg g-1.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can SM-3 be recycled for iodine adsorption after the initial use?",
      "answer": "True. SM-3 can be recycled for iodine adsorption after the initial use, maintaining more than 70.24% iodine removal efficiency even after three cycles.",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of anionic cloud created by nitrate ions in the adsorption of organic dyes by SM-3?",
      "answer": "The anionic cloud created by nitrate ions on the periphery of the SM-3 network plays a crucial role in the adsorption of organic dyes by facilitating strong electrostatic interactions with cationic dyes.",

      "question": "What experimental techniques were used to characterize the structure and adsorption properties of SM-3?",
      "answer": "The structure and adsorption properties of SM-3 were characterized using techniques such as single-crystal X-ray diffraction, FTIR spectroscopy, UV-visible spectrophotometry, thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).",

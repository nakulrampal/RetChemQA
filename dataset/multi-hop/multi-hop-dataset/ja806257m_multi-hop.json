          "Question": "What is the significance of the change in space group from C2/m at 298 K to P-1 at 10 K for the compound 2a?",
          "Answer": "The change in space group signifies a phase transition in the crystal structure of 2a, which could be related to changes in molecular orientation or packing within the crystal lattice as the temperature decreases.",

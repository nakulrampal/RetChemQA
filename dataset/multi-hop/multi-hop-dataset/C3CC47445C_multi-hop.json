      "question": "What is the role of O2 in the oxidative C(sp3)–H bond cleavage and C–C coupling reactions mediated by platinum(II) complexes?",
      "answer": "O2 acts as the sole oxidant in the oxidative C(sp3)–H bond cleavage and stepwise C–C coupling reactions mediated by platinum(II) complexes.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the presence of TEMPO affect the oxidation reactions of Na[3] and Na[4] with O2?",
      "answer": "The presence of TEMPO does not inhibit the oxidation reactions of Na[3] and Na[4] with O2, as no O-alkyl TEMPO derivatives were formed and the reactions proceeded to completion.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What experimental evidence supports the mechanism involving the formation of a PtIV center and hydride abstraction by PtIV in the oxidative C–H bond cleavage/C–C coupling reactions?",
      "answer": "The formation of 18O-labeled products in reactions with 18O2, the observation of CD3H or C6D5H upon oxidation of partially deuterated complexes in CD3OD, and the formation of a stable trimethylplatinum(IV) complex 13 with a short agostic (d-C)H–PtIV bond support the mechanism involving the formation of a PtIV center and hydride abstraction by PtIV.",

    {
      "question": "True or False: The oxidation of Na[4] and Na[5] with O2 in CD3OD leads to the formation of methane and benzene, respectively.",

      "question": "What is the significance of the catalytic aerobic oxidation of NaBH(OMe)3 and NaBH4 by complex 11?",
      "answer": "The catalytic aerobic oxidation of NaBH(OMe)3 and NaBH4 by complex 11 demonstrates the potential of complex 11 as a catalyst for the oxidation of hydride donors with O2, showing high turnover frequencies.",

      "question": "True or False: The reaction of Na[3] with O2 under conditions of oxygen starvation leads to the selective formation of a C–C coupled product Na[8].",

      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the structure of the new borate ligand and derived anionic PtII complexes contribute to their reactivity towards O2?",
      "answer": "The structure of the new borate ligand and derived anionic PtII complexes, featuring hydrocarbyl groups at the PtII center and a 9-borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane fragment, contributes to their reactivity towards O2 by facilitating oxidative cleavage of C(sp3)–H bonds and enabling stepwise C–C coupling at the boron center.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The use of H2O2 instead of O2 in the reaction with Na[3] leads to the formation of the same products.",
      "answer": "True",

      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does the 9-borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (9-BBN) fragment play in the reactivity of the organoplatinum(II) organoborates Na[2]–Na[5]?",
      "answer": "The 9-borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (9-BBN) fragment in the organoplatinum(II) organoborates Na[2]–Na[5] resists B-to-PtIV hydrocarbyl migration due to its rigid bicyclic structure, influencing the pathway of the oxidative C–H bond cleavage and C–C coupling reactions.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The formation of CD3H or C6D5H upon oxidation of partially deuterated complexes in CD3OD indicates the involvement of free alkyl radicals in the oxidative C–H bond cleavage/C–C coupling reactions.",

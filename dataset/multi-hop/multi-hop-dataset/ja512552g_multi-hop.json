    {
      "question": "How does the fluorescence of ZJU-56–0.20 change upon UV light irradiation?",
      "answer": "The emission band around 450 nm decreases rapidly, while a new band centered at 550 nm emerges and increases gradually, eventually resulting in the fluorescence color change of the MOF from blue to yellow.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of the femtosecond laser in the study of the two-photon responsive MOF?",
      "answer": "The femtosecond laser is used to spatially initiate the chemical reactions and engineer the two-photon excited fluorescence property of MOF crystal in the 3D structure, leading to the 3D two-photon patterning and fluorescence imaging.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the two-photon absorption properties of the linker L1 in the context of the study?",
      "answer": "The two-photon absorption properties of the linker L1 enable the spatial initiation of chemical reactions within the MOF crystal, allowing for the creation of functional patterns inside the MOF crystals for potential applications in chemical sensors, optical switches, data storage, and circuits.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {

      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the structural change observed in the linker L1 upon UV light irradiation?",
      "answer": "Upon UV light irradiation, the linker L1 undergoes a chemical change through nucleophilic addition and subsequent oxidation, transforming the pyridine ring and leading to the formation of A−π–D−π–A π-conjugation, a typical structure of two-photon excited fluorescent molecules.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The two-photon excited fluorescence patterns created in the MOF crystal are reversible and can be erased.",

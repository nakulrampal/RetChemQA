      "question": "What is the main concept introduced for H2 activation in the text, and how does it differ from traditional transition-metal chemistry?",
      "answer": "The main concept introduced for H2 activation is combining concepts of transition-metal and frustrated Lewis pair chemistry to confer ambiphilic, metal-like reactivity toward H2 to 9,10-dihydro-9,10-diboraanthracene (DBA) acceptors by injecting two electrons. This differs from traditional transition-metal chemistry where H2 splitting results from the interaction between a vacant metal d orbital and the H2 s-MO, augmented by back-bonding from a filled d orbital into the H2 s*-MO.",

      "question": "What are the conditions under which the reversible and irreversible addition of H2 to DBA acceptors occurs, and how do these conditions affect the reaction?",
      "answer": "The reversible addition of H2 to DBA acceptors occurs under moderate conditions (T = 50–100 88C; p < 1 atm) and depends on the boron-bonded substituents R, with R = C/CtBu being reversible and R = H being irreversible. The reaction rate is strongly influenced by the nature and coordination behavior of the countercation, with Li+ being slower than K+.",

      "question": "What experimental evidence supports the reversible thermolysis reaction between Li2[3] and Li2[4]/H2?",
      "answer": "The experimental evidence supporting the reversible thermolysis reaction is the observation that upon heating a solution of Li2[4] under an H2 atmosphere, the signals belonging to Li2[4] lost intensity while resonances assignable to Li2[3] gradually evolved, indicating a dynamic equilibrium between Li2[3] and Li2[4]/H2.",

      "answer": "The addition of 12-crown-4 or the replacement of Li+ with K+ promotes cation dissociation, which is assumed to create the necessary space for the incoming H2 substrate, thereby potentially accelerating the H2-activation reaction and lowering the required temperatures.",

      "answer": "Quantum-chemical calculations suggest a concerted, homolytic addition of H2 across both boron atoms for H2 activation by [DBA]2@, with the formation of [5]2@ being exergonic and the process requiring passage of a moderate activation barrier.",

      "answer": "The outcome of treating Li2[5] in [D8]THF with Me3SiCl is the quantitative formation of Me3SiH, leaving the DBA skeleton largely intact. This implies that MGAs like M2[1] salts could be used for converting element halides into element hydrides using H2 in the presence of suitable 9,10-dihydro-9,10-diboraanthracenes as redox catalysts.",

      "answer": "The presence of alkynyl substituents in [4]2@ leads to a significantly less stable dihydride adduct compared to the bare dianion [1]2@, consistent with the experimentally observed reversibility of the H2 addition only for [3]2@.",

      "answer": "The sterically demanding alkynyl substituents in Li2[3] likely occupy both equatorial positions in the central B2C4 ring, which not only explains the observed NMR spectral features but also places the two hydrogen substituents in axial positions, rendering them ideally preoriented for the concerted elimination of H2.",

      "answer": "In the context of the DBA acceptors' reactivity toward H2, 'ambiphilic' implies that these acceptors exhibit both electron-accepting and electron-donating properties, allowing them to engage in metal-like reactivity toward H2 by injecting two electrons and cleaving the H@H bond.",

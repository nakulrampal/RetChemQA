      "question": "What is the role of the third functional group in the synthesis of zeolite-type frameworks using polyfunctional ligands?",
      "answer": "The third functional group, referred to as the 'hook', is used to immobilize other species, such as monomeric and dimeric metal clusters, within the channels of the zeolite-type frameworks.",

    {
      "question": "How does the number of hooks relate to the type of zeolite topology and channel size?",
      "answer": "Depending on the type of zeolite topology and channel size, two, three, or even four hooks are positioned and oriented in such a way that they cooperatively capture the same metal ion or cluster.",

      "question": "What demonstrates the versatility of the synthesis method described in the text?",
      "answer": "The synthesis method's versatility is demonstrated by the creation of three distinct metal–organic frameworks mimicking different zeolite topologies (AFI, BCT, and lcs) and the ability to modify channels with different metal ions and clusters.",

    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the '4-2-1 method' mentioned in the synthesis of zeolite-type frameworks?",
      "answer": "The '4-2-1 method' signifies a synthesis strategy where two functional groups form zeolite-type nets (framework-forming groups), and the remaining functional group (the hook) immobilizes other species, offering a versatile path for framework modification.",

    {
      "question": "How does the synthesis approach address the limitation of relying on ditopic ligands for creating metal–organic zeolites?",
      "answer": "The synthesis approach overcomes the limitation by using polyfunctional ligands, allowing for the utilization of a broader range of organic ligands by assigning different roles to the available functional groups.",

    {
      "question": "What role do the captured metal ions or clusters play in controlling the zeolite topology?",
      "answer": "The captured metal ions or clusters act as structure-directing agents through covalent metal–hook interactions, offering a new mechanism for controlling the zeolite topology.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does the synthesis of CPM-16-Co begin, and what are its inorganic building blocks?",
      "answer": "The synthesis of CPM-16-Co begins with a mixture of In(NO3)3·xH2O, Co(NO3)2·4H2O, and H3btc stirred in a mixed solution of H2O/DMA, leading to the formation of purple crystals. Its inorganic building blocks include tetrahedral indium node {In(COO)4}, hydroxy-bridged V-type cobalt dimer {Co2(OH)(COO)2(H2O)6}, and paddlewheel cobalt dimer {Co2(COO)3(H2O)2}.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What is the correlation between the framework topology/channel size and the type of metal species captured within them?",
      "answer": "The correlation reveals a unique type of bidirectional control where the framework topology and channel size influence the type of metal species captured within them, and vice versa, allowing for the creation of a large family of materials with modified channels.",

      "question": "What is the primary functional significance of coordination networks as mentioned in the text?",
      "answer": "Functionalization of coordination networks is crucial for their application, particularly because they often contain substitution-active metal sites that allow for ligand exchange, affecting their d-orbital configuration and leading to electronic and spin control.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the ligand exchange process affect cobalt in the context of the study?",
      "answer": "The ligand exchange process leads to chromism in cobalt, observable in the solid state as a color change upon ligand exchange.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role do the ethylene glycol side chains play in the stability and flexibility of the coordination network?",
      "answer": "The ethylene glycol side chains contribute to the stabilization of the crystal through hydrogen-bond formation and introduce moderate flexibility inside the cavity, allowing guest molecules to behave as in solution.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What experimental method was used to grow single crystals of the coordination network?",

      "question": "What change occurs to the coordination network upon heating at 150 8C for 24 hours?",
      "answer": "Upon heating at 150 8C for 24 hours, the apical water molecules in the coordination network are substituted by two nitrate ions, turning the crystal red without loss of crystallinity.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the reversible apical-ligand-exchange reaction observed in the study?",
      "answer": "The reversible apical-ligand-exchange reaction is significant because it demonstrates the ability to control the electronic and structural properties of the coordination network in situ, which is rare for bimolecular reactions observed by X-ray crystallography.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the chromism of the crystal relate to the apical-ligand exchange?",
      "answer": "The chromism of the crystal is directly related to the apical-ligand exchange, as the exchange leads to an energy-level change of the d orbitals of cobalt, causing a red shift of the absorption bands.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens to the crystal's cell volume after the substitution of water molecules with nitrate ions?",
      "answer": "After the substitution of water molecules with nitrate ions, the crystal's cell volume decreases from 4263.9(7) to 4036.0(16) cubic angstroms.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the framework of the coordination network respond to the removal of water molecules?",
      "answer": "The framework of the coordination network responds to the removal of water molecules by slightly compressing, which leads to a decrease in cell volume and is offset by dynamic disordering of the flexible ethylene glycol chains.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What analytical techniques were used to confirm the structural changes in the coordination network?",

    {
      "question": "What is the role of hydrogen bonds in the stability of the coordination network?",
      "answer": "Hydrogen bonds, particularly through infinite 1D hydrogen-bond arrays, play a crucial role in stabilizing the coordination network by interpenetrating the layers.",

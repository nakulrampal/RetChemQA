      "question": "What is the role of ZnII ions in the synthesis of the MOFs discussed in the text?",
      "answer": "ZnII ions are coordinated with C3-symmetric tridentate N-donor ligands to produce 2D metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) with anion-confining cages.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How do the properties of the nanochannels in the MOFs change upon the inclusion of FAHs?",
      "answer": "The inclusion of FAHs into the nanochannels results in the formation of hydrophobic nanochannels that effectively adsorb a wide range of fused aromatic hydrocarbons as monomers or dimers.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the p-p stacking interactions in the MOFs?",
      "answer": "The p-p stacking interactions are crucial for the assembly of the 2D MOFs and the formation of 3D MOFs consisting of nanochannels. They also play a key role in the inclusion and organization of FAHs within the MOFs.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What determines the inclusion capacity of FAHs in the MOFs?",
      "answer": "The inclusion capacity of FAHs in the MOFs is determined by the nature of the FAH, mediated by p-p stacking interactions between FAH molecules themselves and between FAH and the Zn-MOF skeletal structure inside the anion-confining nanochannels.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do ANT and PHE show a significant bathochromic shift when included in the MOFs?",
      "answer": "The significant bathochromic shift observed for ANT and PHE when included in the MOFs is attributed to the occurrence of a dimeric p-p stacking orientation of ANT and PHE within the nanochannels.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the effect of solvent polarity on the inclusion of FAHs into the MOFs?",
      "answer": "The effect of solvent polarity on the inclusion of FAHs into the MOFs is inversely proportional to the polarity, with n-hexane being the most effective solvent followed by benzene, diethyl ether, and dioxane/dichloromethane.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the relationship between the structure of the MOFs and their ability to host FAHs?",
      "answer": "The structure of the MOFs, characterized by hydrophobic nanochannels formed by p-p stacking of cyanurate moieties and anion-confining cages, is crucial for their ability to host, include, and organize FAHs.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the inclusion of FAHs affect the photoluminescence properties of the MOFs?",
      "answer": "The inclusion of FAHs affects the photoluminescence properties of the MOFs by generating broad emission bands and significant bathochromic shifts, indicative of the formation of dimeric FAHs within the channels.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What factors influence the guest inclusion in the MOFs?",
      "answer": "Factors influencing guest inclusion in the MOFs include the nature of the FAH, the solvent used for inclusion, and the counterions employed, with p-p and van der Waals interactions playing a key role.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the presence of counterions affect the structure and properties of the MOFs?",
      "answer": "The presence of counterions, such as BF4- or ClO4-, affects the structure and properties of the MOFs by serving as structure-directing templates for building the cages that encapsulate them, thereby influencing the hydrophobicity of the nanochannels.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of the C3-symmetric tridentate ligand in the formation of the MOFs?",
      "answer": "The C3-symmetric tridentate ligand acts as a key triangular building block for self-assembly of the 2D kagome-type network by coordination to ZnII ions, leading to the formation of the new topological 2D network.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How do the MOFs facilitate the inclusion and energy transfer of FAH molecules?",
      "answer": "The MOFs facilitate the inclusion and energy transfer of FAH molecules through their unique 3D structure consisting of hydrophobic nanochannels and anion-confining cages, which allow for the organization of FAHs and promote Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between them.",

    {
      "question": "How does the synthesis condition of MOF 1 differ from MOF 2?",
      "answer": "MOF 1 is synthesized by reacting H4TCPE with Zn(NO3)2·6H2O in a mixture of DEF and ethanol at 75 °C, while MOF 2 is synthesized using Cd(NO3)2·4H2O as the metal source under slightly different conditions.",

    {
      "question": "What is the relationship between the synthesis conditions of MOFs and their structural and photophysical properties?",
      "answer": "The synthesis conditions, such as the choice of metal source and reaction temperature, directly influence the coordination geometry, solvent content, and ultimately the structural and photophysical properties of the MOFs, including their luminescence behavior.",

    },
    {
      "question": "Why are MOFs 1 and 2 luminescent despite the absence of close-packed TPE cores?",
      "answer": "MOFs 1 and 2 are luminescent due to the coordinative immobilization of fluorescent TCPE4– cores inside rigid MOF matrices, which restricts the rotation of the phenyl rings, turning on fluorescence without the need for close-packed TPE cores.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can the fluorescence quantum yields of MOFs 1 and 2 be improved by altering the substitution pattern on the TPE core?",
      "answer": "True. The text suggests that meta-substitution on the TPE core, which should completely shut off dissipative processes like phenylene rotation or libration, could lead to MOFs with improved quantum yields relative to MOFs 1 and 2.",

    {
      "question": "Does the presence of guest solvent molecules significantly affect the quantum yield of MOF 1?",
      "answer": "False. The relatively low quantum yields of MOF 1 are not majorly affected by vibrational quenching by guest solvent molecules, suggesting that the rotation of the phenyl rings, not completely shut off in TCPE4– despite MOF incorporation, causes partial quenching of the fluorescence.",

    },
    {
      "question": "Are the structural differences between MOFs 2 and 3 a result of their different synthesis conditions?",
      "answer": "True. The subtle polymorphic differences between MOFs 2 and 3, such as solvent content and orientation of TCPE4- units, likely result from slight modifications in reaction conditions like heating rates, leading to the formation of two modifications.",

      "question": "How does the fluorescence quantum yield of MOF 1 compare to that of H4TCPE?",
      "answer": "The fluorescence quantum yield of MOF 1 is slightly higher than that of solid H4TCPE, indicating that the coordinative immobilization within the MOF matrix enhances the fluorescence efficiency.",

      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "Does the coordinative immobilization of TCPE4– cores inside MOFs require close-packed TPE cores for fluorescence?",
      "answer": "False. The coordinative immobilization of TCPE4– cores inside MOFs does not require close-packed TPE cores for fluorescence, as it restricts the rotation of the phenyl rings, turning on fluorescence through an alternative mechanism.",

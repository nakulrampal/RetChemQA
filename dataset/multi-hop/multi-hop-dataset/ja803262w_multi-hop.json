      "question": "What is the mechanism behind the 'turn-on' fluorescence of 1−2Zn(II) when it binds to nucleoside polyphosphates?",
      "answer": "The 'turn-on' fluorescence of 1−2Zn(II) is based on the binding-induced recovery of the conjugated form of the xanthene ring from its nonfluorescent deconjugated state, which was formed by an unprecedented nucleophilic attack of zinc-bound water.",

    {
      "question": "How does the chemosensor 1−2Zn(II) differentiate between nucleoside polyphosphates and monophosphate species in terms of fluorescence response?",
      "answer": "1−2Zn(II) selectively senses nucleoside polyphosphates with a large fluorescence enhancement and strong binding affinity, whereas no detectable fluorescence change is induced by monophosphate species and various other anions.",

    {
      "question": "What role does the pH of the solution play in the structural equilibrium of 1−2Zn(II) under neutral aqueous conditions?",
      "answer": "The pH of the solution influences the structural equilibrium between the deconjugated form II and the conjugated form I of 1−2Zn(II), with the deconjugated form II being predominant under neutral aqueous conditions.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does 1−2Zn(II) show a stronger binding affinity and fluorescence enhancement towards polyphosphate derivatives compared to monophosphorylated species?",
      "answer": "1−2Zn(II) shows stronger binding affinity and fluorescence enhancement towards polyphosphate derivatives due to their highly negative characters suitable for binding with the cationic 1−2Zn(II), while the fluorescence change is not induced by monophosphorylated species due to lack of multiple interactions.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the fluorescence sensing ability of 1−2Zn(II) affected by pH changes in the physiological range?",
      "answer": "No, significant fluorescence intensity changes were not observed for both 1−2Zn(II) and its ATP binding complex in the pH range from 6 to 9, indicating that the turn-on fluorescence sensing of 1−2Zn(II) works effectively in physiological pH conditions.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can 1−2Zn(II) penetrate cell membranes for intracellular ATP visualization?",
      "answer": "No, 1−2Zn(II) does not penetrate cell membranes. For intracellular ATP visualization, 1 was modified by acetylation at both hydroxyl groups to increase its lipophilicity, allowing the modified complex to penetrate cell membranes.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the fluorescence response of 1−2Zn(II) to ATP compare to that of ADP?",
      "answer": "1−2Zn(II) shows a lower recovery ratio in the binding with ADP compared to ATP, despite having almost the same binding affinity towards these polyphosphate species. This is partially attributable to the difference in their absorbance in the excitation wavelength region.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the μ-oxo−dizinc(II) core in the structure of 1−2Zn(II)?",
      "answer": "The μ-oxo−dizinc(II) core in the structure of 1−2Zn(II) is essential for inducing nucleophilic attack to the xanthene ring in neutral pH, leading to the deconjugated, nonfluorescent form of 1−2Zn(II).",
      "difficulty": "hard",

    },
    {
      "question": "Does the presence of Zn(II)/Dpa units in 1−2Zn(II) contribute to its selective staining of ATP stores inside living cells?",
      "answer": "Yes, the Zn(II)/Dpa units of 1−2Zn(II) are essential for selective staining of ATP stores inside living cells, as demonstrated by the lack of localized fluorescence when staining experiments were conducted with ligand 4 in the absence of Zn(II) ions.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What experimental evidence supports the hypothesis that 1−2Zn(II) accumulates in particulates containing high concentrations of ATP inside living cells?",
      "answer": "The experimental evidence supporting this hypothesis is the observation that the fluorescence particles of 1−2Zn(II) merged well with the fluorescence image obtained by costaining with quinacrine, a widely used probe to locate ATP stores, indicating that 1−2Zn(II) accumulates in the particulates containing high concentrations of ATP.",

    {
      "question": "What are the molecular structures of the Fe28 clusters described?",
      "answer": "The molecular structures of the Fe28 clusters described include four {Fe7} subunits connected by four tartaric acid linkers.",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How do the Fe28 enantiomers demonstrate chiral recognition in their racemic mixture solutions?",
      "answer": "The Fe28 enantiomers demonstrate chiral recognition in their racemic mixture solutions by forming homogeneous blackberry structures, indicating a high level of self-recognition.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role do chiral co-anions play in the self-assembly process of Fe28 macroanions?",
      "answer": "Chiral co-anions selectively suppress the self-assembly process of one enantiomer while maintaining the assembly of the other, leading to chiral selection during the self-assembly process.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the study on chiral recognition and selection using Fe28 macroanions?",
      "answer": "The study on chiral recognition and selection using Fe28 macroanions indicates that simple inorganic macroions exhibit chiral recognition and selection during their assembly process, suggesting that biomacromolecules' related features might be due to their macroionic nature via long-range electrostatic interactions.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How were the Fe28 enantiomers separated from their racemic mixtures?",
      "answer": "The Fe28 enantiomers were separated from their racemic mixtures by introducing chiral anionic molecules, which led to chiral selection and allowed for separation based on the size difference between monomers and assemblies.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The Fe28 clusters consist of two {Fe7} subunits connected by tartaric acid linkers.",
      "answer": "False",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: Chiral co-anions have no effect on the self-assembly process of Fe28 macroanions.",
      "answer": "False",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The study of Fe28 macroanions provides insights into the chiral recognition and selection mechanisms that might be applicable to understanding biomacromolecules.",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The Fe28 enantiomers form heterogeneous blackberry structures in their racemic mixture solutions.",
      "answer": "False",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The separation of Fe28 enantiomers from their racemic mixtures is achieved through the use of non-chiral anionic molecules.",
      "answer": "False",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "True or False"

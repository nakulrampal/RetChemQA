    },
    {
      "question": "Why were the synthesized anions described as remarkably stable, and how does this stability relate to their electronic structure?",
      "answer": "The synthesized anions are described as remarkably stable due to the decreased contribution of the 2@Pn@C/Ch+ resonance to their overall structure, which hampers decomposition pathways and is reflected in their electronic structure, indicating strong bonding and resistance to decomposition.",

      "question": "How does the bond metric data support the triple-bond character for the Pn/C bonds in the synthesized anions?",

      "question": "What is the main advantage of integrating organic thermally activated delayed fluorescence photosensitizer with zinc node in Spiro-Zn-MOF?",
      "answer": "The main advantage is enhancing the lifetime of excited state, which leads to a large photocathode current in the scaffold allowing for high photoreduction rate.",

    {
      "question": "How does the structure of Spiro-Zn-MOF contribute to its photocatalytic performance?",
      "answer": "The horizontally prolonged linker based on D-A (Donor-Acceptor) unit in Spiro-Zn-MOF provides a delayed lifetime up to micro-second-level for excited state, and the inborn D-A structure works with zinc node in a synergistic way, leading to efficient charge transfer.",

    {
      "question": "How does the lifetime of excited state in Spiro-Zn-MOF under various atmospheres contribute to its photocatalytic performance?",
      "answer": "The micro-second lifetime of TADF maintained in Spiro-Zn-MOF under various atmospheres contributes to high photostability for long-lived excited state, enhancing its photocatalytic performance.",

    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the EPR signal enhancement at g = 2.004 for Spiro-Zn-MOF under illumination by Xe lamp?",
      "answer": "The EPR signal enhancement at g = 2.004 indicates that photogenerated electrons transferred from excited SATC to the Zn sites to form the signal of zinc radical, demonstrating the metal site as the reaction core of photocatalyst to reduce CO2.",

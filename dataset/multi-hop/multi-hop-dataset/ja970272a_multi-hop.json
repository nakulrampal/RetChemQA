      "question": "What triggers the transformation of α-UPP into β-UPP?",
      "answer": "The transformation of α-UPP into β-UPP is significantly accelerated by increasing the humidity of the environment or by dehydrating the crystals of α-UPP and then rehydrating them in air saturated with water vapor.",

      "question": "What are the two novel energetic metal–organic frameworks (EMOFs) synthesized in the study?",
      "answer": "[Pb(OH-Tz)2]n and [Pb(OH-Tz)(NO3)]n",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What method was used to calculate the energy of detonation (ΔEdet) for the EMOFs?",
      "answer": "Density functional theory (DFT)",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does the laser initiation threshold of [Pb(OH-Tz)2]n compare to [Pb(OH-Tz)(NO3)]n?",
      "answer": "Both EMOFs have a laser initiation threshold of less than 7 mJ, but [Pb(OH-Tz)(NO3)]n responds more rapidly to the laser.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"

    {
      "question": "Is the oxygen balance of [Pb(OH-Tz)2]n positive or negative, and how does it compare to [Pb(OH-Tz)(NO3)]n?",
      "answer": "The oxygen balance of [Pb(OH-Tz)2]n is negative (-16.97 %), while [Pb(OH-Tz)(NO3)]n shows a positive oxygen balance.",

    {
      "question": "What is the impact of the oxygen balance on the detonation performance of [Pb(OH-Tz)(NO3)]n?",
      "answer": "The positive oxygen balance of [Pb(OH-Tz)(NO3)]n affects its detonation performance but may serve as a high-energy additive component to improve the oxygen balance of the formula.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The thermal stability of [Pb(OH-Tz)(NO3)]n is significantly lower than that of [Pb(OH-Tz)2]n due to the presence of nitrate.",

      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of the coordination bond network in the EMOFs' structures?",
      "answer": "The coordination bond network makes the structure of EMOFs compact, improves mechanical stability, and contributes to higher energy density and energy release level.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The detonation velocity of [Pb(OH-Tz)2]n is equivalent to those of RDX and HMX.",

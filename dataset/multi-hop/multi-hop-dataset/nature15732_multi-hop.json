      "question": "What is the main advantage of using natural gas over petroleum as a source of energy for the transportation sector?",
      "answer": "Natural gas has considerable environmental, economic, and political advantages over petroleum as a source of energy for the transportation sector.",

      "question": "Why does the low volumetric energy density of natural gas at ambient temperature and pressure present challenges for its use in light-duty vehicles?",
      "answer": "The low volumetric energy density of natural gas at ambient temperature and pressure presents challenges for its use in light-duty vehicles due to the limited space available for on-board fuel storage.",

    {
      "question": "What strategy was used in the synthesis of Co(bdp) to potentially enhance methane storage?",
      "answer": "The strategy used in the synthesis of Co(bdp) involved heating Co(CF3SO3)2 and H2bdp in a mixture of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and methanol, followed by multiple washing steps with hot DMF and drying under high vacuum, aiming to potentially enhance methane storage.",

    {
      "question": "How does the structural phase transition in Co(bdp) and Fe(bdp) contribute to methane storage?",
      "answer": "The structural phase transition in Co(bdp) and Fe(bdp) contributes to methane storage by maximizing the deliverable capacity of CH4 while also providing internal heat management during adsorption and desorption, due to the transition between a collapsed, non-porous framework and an expanded, porous framework at specific CH4 pressures.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the stepped methane adsorption isotherm observed in Co(bdp) and Fe(bdp)?",
      "answer": "The significance of the stepped methane adsorption isotherm observed in Co(bdp) and Fe(bdp) lies in enabling greater storage capacities than classical adsorbents, while also reducing the amount of heat released during adsorption and the impact of cooling during desorption, due to the sharp 'step' that results from a structural phase transition.",

      "question": "True or False: The usable methane capacity of Co(bdp) at 25 Â°C is higher than all known adsorbents for adsorption at 35 bar and 65 bar.",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"

    {
      "question": "True or False: The structural phase transition in Co(bdp) and Fe(bdp) does not affect the calculated crystallographic densities of each phase.",

      "type": "True or False"

    {
      "question": "True or False: The paracrystalline distortions observed in the collapsed phases of Co(bdp) and Fe(bdp) significantly affect the accuracy of the average crystal structures.",

      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does applying external mechanical pressure affect the methane adsorption and desorption step pressures in Co(bdp)?",
      "answer": "Applying external mechanical pressure affects the methane adsorption and desorption step pressures in Co(bdp) by shifting both steps to higher CH4 pressures, consistent with an increase in the energy of the phase transition, and maintaining hysteresis at higher pressures.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What potential benefits does the temperature dependence of the CH4 isotherms of Co(bdp) and Fe(bdp) offer for driving in cold-weather climates?",
      "answer": "The temperature dependence of the CH4 isotherms of Co(bdp) and Fe(bdp) offers the potential benefit of reducing the effect of cooling during desorption, as long as the temperature stays above certain thresholds, thereby reducing the overall thermal management required in an ANG system.",

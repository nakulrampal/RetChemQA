      "question": "Why are organic dyes selected as guest molecules for studying ion-exchange properties of P-MOFs?",
      "answer": "Organic dyes are selected as guest molecules because they have appropriate molecular mass (at the 100â€“1,000 Da level), ease of detection, and their charges and sizes can be varied, making them suitable for studying ion-exchange properties.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the charge of the framework influence the ion-exchange process with organic dyes?",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can the ion-exchange process with P-MOFs be reversed, and if so, how?",
      "answer": "Yes, the ion-exchange process with P-MOFs can be reversed by shifting the dynamic equilibrium between different guests, which can be achieved by changing the relative concentrations, such as by adding excess NaNO3 to trigger the release of previously exchanged anions.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the ion-exchange capacity of P-MOFs affected by the concentration of the dye in the solution?",
      "answer": "Yes, the ion-exchange capacity of P-MOFs is affected by the concentration of the dye in the solution, with higher dye concentrations leading to a higher percentage of NO3- being replaced by the dye when the ion-exchange reaches equilibrium.",

      "question": "How does the ion-exchange process of P-MOFs demonstrate potential for drug delivery applications?",
      "answer": "The ion-exchange process of P-MOFs demonstrates potential for drug delivery applications through its controlled release mechanism, where the release of guest anions can be triggered by changing the concentration of other ions, making it suitable for controlled drug release.",

      "question": "What is the significance of using a series of azo type dyes with similar backbone but different charges and sizes in the study?",
      "answer": "Using a series of azo type dyes with similar backbone but different charges and sizes is significant because it allows for the systematic study of how charge and size of guest molecules influence the ion-exchange dynamics with P-MOFs, enabling the exploration of charge and size selectivity in the ion-exchange process.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What method is proposed to analyze and estimate the accessibility of guest molecules to the pores of P-MOFs?",
      "answer": "A method proposed to analyze and estimate the accessibility involves using static structural models to define two window dimensions (dmin and dmax) and the size of a guest molecule using a cuboid model (MIN-2), which simplifies the prediction of whether a given guest can access a certain host based on size-exclusion.",

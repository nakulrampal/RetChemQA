      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How was the porosity of IRMOF-77 confirmed?",
      "answer": "The porosity of IRMOF-77 was confirmed through N2 adsorption isotherms measured at 77 K, showing steep N2 uptake in the low-pressure region, indicating microporosity.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What method was used to analyze the pore size distribution of activated IRMOF-77?",
      "answer": "The pore size distribution of activated IRMOF-77 was analyzed using nonlocal density functional theory (NLDFT) based on a hybrid kernel for Ar adsorption at 87 K.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What was the result of attempting postsynthetic generations of NHC from IRMOF-76?",
      "answer": "The attempts at postsynthetic generations of NHC from IRMOF-76, including treatment with Brönsted base, Ag2O or Ag2CO3, and formation of CN-/CCl3-/alkoxide adduct for thermal α-elimination, were not successful.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What changes were observed in the TGA trace of IRMOF-77 after quinoline exchange?",
      "answer": "The TGA trace of quinoline-exchanged IRMOF-77 showed a weight loss around 180 ºC, attributed to the partial loss of coordinated pyridine, indicating the successful substitution of the pyridine coligand.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What was the purpose of using a critical point dryer in the activation of IRMOF-77?",
      "answer": "The critical point dryer was used in the activation of IRMOF-77 to prevent the collapse of the porous structure by ensuring a gentle removal of solvents, preserving the material's porosity.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the presence of both BF4- and PF6- counteranions in IRMOF-76 confirmed by 19F NMR spectroscopy?",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {

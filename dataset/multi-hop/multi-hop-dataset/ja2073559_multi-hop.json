      "question": "What are the synthesis conditions for the coordination network solid described in the text?",
      "answer": "The coordination network solid was synthesized by crystallizing molecules L1 and L2 with Pb(II) under solvothermal conditions. For L1, a solution of water and acetonitrile was used, while for L2, a mixture of dimethylformamide (DMF) and water was employed.",

    {
      "question": "What is the role of secondary groups in the synthesis of the coordination network solid?",
      "answer": "Secondary groups, specifically CH3S- and (S)-CH3(OH)CHCH2S- (2-hydroxylpropyl), were attached to the 2,5- positions of 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid (bdc) to fine-tune the structures and properties of the coordination networks, showcasing the idea of secondary group participation (SGP) in the construction of coordination networks.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does the presence of hydroxy groups in PbL2 influence its properties compared to PbL1?",
      "answer": "The presence of hydroxy groups in PbL2, due to secondary group participation, subtly modifies the bonding features around the Pb(II) centers, leading to a significant impact on its properties. While PbL1 exhibits yellowish green photoluminescence, PbL2 features bright white emission and significant second harmonic generation.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The secondary groups in the synthesis of the coordination network solid are expected to remain nonbonded and serve as free-standing functions decorating the host net.",
      "answer": "False",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the impact of the chiral side groups on the crystal structure and properties of the coordination network solid?",
      "answer": "The chiral side groups impose a polar space group on the crystal structure and contribute to the acentric assembly, which is crucial for achieving significant quadratic nonlinear optical properties, as demonstrated by the second harmonic generation efficiency of the coordination network solid.",

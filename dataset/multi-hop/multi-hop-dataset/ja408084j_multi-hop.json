      "question": "What is the significance of the linker elimination strategy in the synthesis of PCN-224 series?",
      "answer": "The linker elimination strategy allows for the construction of new porphyrinic zirconium MOFs with high stability and unexplored catalytic activity by tuning the coordination environment around the Zr6 cluster, leading to MOFs with novel Zr6 clusters that bind fewer linkers and have different symmetries.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the BET surface area of PCN-224(Ni) compare to other reported porphyrinic MOFs?",
      "answer": "The BET surface area of PCN-224(Ni) is the highest among all reported porphyrinic MOFs, attributed to its 3-D large open channels in the framework.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What is the impact of the Zr-TCPP ratio on the connectivity of the Zr6 cluster in PCN-224?",
      "answer": "Increasing the Zr-TCPP ratio in the starting material leads to more Zr atoms competing to coordinate with the TCPP ligand, eventually reducing the connection numbers to six and altering the cluster symmetry to D3d.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The synthesis of PCN-224 involves the use of a high-oxidation-state metal species with carboxylate linkers.",

    {
      "question": "What is the effect of introducing metalloporphyrins into MOFs on their applications?",
      "answer": "The incorporation of metalloporphyrins into MOFs introduces evenly distributed catalytic centers, enhancing their applications in catalysis and other areas under chemically harsh conditions.",

    {
      "question": "How does the presence of hydroxyl groups in the Zr6 cluster of PCN-222 influence its chemical stability?",
      "answer": "The introduction of hydroxyl groups in the Zr6 cluster of PCN-222 improves the hardness of the Zr6 core, strengthening the bonding between the bridging ligands and the Zr6 units, thereby enhancing the chemical stability of the MOF.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"

    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the dihedral angle between a phenyl ring and the porphyrin center in the TCPP ligand for PCN-224?",
      "answer": "The dihedral angle influences the framework structure, with the average dihedral angle in PCN-224 being different from that in PCN-222, contributing to the formation of 3-D channels and affecting the MOF's porosity and surface area.",

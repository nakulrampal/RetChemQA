      "question": "What was the outcome of exposing the arylzinc reagent to air in the presence of Mg(OPiv)2?",

      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What does the presence of OH- and O2- ions in the crystal structure of Mg(OPiv)2 suggest about its function?",
      "answer": "It suggests that Mg(OPiv)2 could be functioning as a decontaminating agent, mopping up OH- or trapping related ions to protect zinc species from contaminants.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"

    {
      "question": "What was the effect of air exposure on the stability of (aryl)ZnCl reagents compared to (alkyl)ZnCl reagents?",

      "answer": "The structure, showing Mg centers linked by H2O and pivalate anion bridges, suggests Mg(OPiv)2 can capture and hold on to H2O molecules, making them less accessible for hydrolyzing C-Zn bonds.",

      "question": "How does the addition of LiCl to Zn(OPiv)2 in THF lead to the formation of a soluble complex?",
      "answer": "LiCl completes the coordination of both the Lewis basic OPiv group and Lewis acidic Zn atom, forming a soluble molecular complex.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why were different solvents and conditions tested in the cross-coupling reactions with zinc reagents?",
      "answer": "To evaluate the effect of air, solvent polarity, and the presence of Mg salt on the yield and stability of the zinc reagents during cross-coupling reactions.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What was the observed effect of thoroughly drying pivalic acid on the contamination of Mg(OPiv)2 with O2- ions?",
      "answer": "Thoroughly drying pivalic acid did not prevent O2- contamination in Mg(OPiv)2, suggesting the contamination came from the commercial Mg(nBu)2 used.",

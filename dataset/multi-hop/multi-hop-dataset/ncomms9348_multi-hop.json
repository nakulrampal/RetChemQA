      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the unit-cell volume of the product crystals compare to the most-open form of MIL-88B after the CTC reactions?",
      "answer": "The unit-cell volumes of the product crystals are larger than that of the most-open form of MIL-88B.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of the Fe3 coordination template in the CTC reactions?",
      "answer": "The Fe3 coordination template fixes three molecules in an ideal configuration to facilitate the [2 + 2 + 2] CTC reactions.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens to the framework flexibility and gas adsorption performance of MIL-88B after the CTC reactions?",
      "answer": "The framework becomes more rigid and the gas adsorption performance drastically improves.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The CTC reactions in MIL-88B require a high reaction temperature and a catalyst.",

      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The intermediate state with three 4-pyCN monomers simultaneously coordinating at the same Fe3 coordination template was observed by diffraction techniques.",

      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the effect of using 3-cyanopyridine (3-pyCN) as a monomer in the CTC reaction?",
      "answer": "The expected trimeric product of 3-pyCN cannot be obtained, indicating that MIL-88B cannot catalyze the trimerization reactions involving monomers with unsuitable coordination sites and molecular geometry.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the Fe3 coordination template's arrangement in facilitating the CTC reactions?",
      "answer": "The triangular arrangement of the Fe3 coordination template forces every three unsaturated groups of the monomer ligands to gather in a close configuration suitable for the cyclotrimerization reaction.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The CTC reaction mechanism is mainly controlled by the organic reaction rather than the ligand substitution reaction.",

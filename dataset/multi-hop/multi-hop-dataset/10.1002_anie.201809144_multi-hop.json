      "question": "How does the introduction of non-3d metals affect the adsorption energies of H2O and O2 on cobalt sites?",
      "answer": "The introduction of non-3d metals increases the affinity to polar H2O molecule via raising the Co charge/oxidation state and affects the interactions between nonpolar O2 molecule and Co ions, which is not only contributed by the Coulomb effect but also the charge transfer between the p* and metal d orbital.",

      "answer": "[Bi9(C9H3O6)9(H2O)9]",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What technique was used to confirm the unit cell parameters of CAU-17?",
      "answer": "Rotation Electron Diffraction (RED)",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What was the motivation behind the synthesis of CAU-17?",
      "answer": "The synthesis experiments of CAU-17 were inspired by previous reports on bismuth carboxylates and the prospect of discovering novel crystalline structures that form under short synthesis conditions.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the crystal structure of CAU-17 affected by twinning?",
      "answer": "Yes, the crystal structure determination of CAU-17 was impeded by the presence of twinning in all examined crystals.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What was the result of applying a twin matrix during the refinement of CAU-17's crystal structure?",
      "answer": "Upon applying the twin law, the positions of all nine BTC3- anions and nine coordinated water molecules were immediately determined in the first subsequent difference Fourier map.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What does the thermogravimetric analysis of CAU-17 reveal about its composition?",
      "answer": "The thermogravimetric analysis reveals the loss of three water molecules and one solvent methanol molecule per Bi3+ cation, indicating the presence of disordered guest species in the pores.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the handedness of helical rods in CAU-17 affect its crystal structure?",
      "answer": "The handedness of helical rods in CAU-17 leads to an apparent smaller unit cell when viewed from the ab-plane due to the indistinguishability of left and right-handed helices from this perspective.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What challenges were encountered during the collection of single-crystal X-ray diffraction data for CAU-17?",
      "answer": "Significant beam damage to the crystal occurred throughout data acquisition, affecting the quality of the collected data.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What does the presence of a 2-fold twin operation in CAU-17 indicate about its crystallography?",
      "answer": "The presence of a 2-fold twin operation suggests that CAU-17 exhibits merohedral twinning, complicating its structure determination.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What was the role of methanol in the synthesis of CAU-17?",
      "answer": "Methanol was used as a solvent in the solvothermal synthesis of CAU-17, inspired by previous findings that certain Bi-MOFs form under short reaction times in methanol.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"

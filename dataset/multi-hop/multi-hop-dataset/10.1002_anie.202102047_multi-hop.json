    },
    {
      "question": "Why do the CP glass membranes exhibit high selectivity in gas separation?",
      "answer": "The CP glass membranes exhibit high selectivity in gas separation due to their ultra-microporous or microporous cavities in their glassy state, leading to a molecular sieving effect.",

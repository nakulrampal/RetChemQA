      "question": "What are the synthesis conditions for the formation of 2-Zn and 2-Cd networks?",
      "answer": "The synthesis conditions for 2-Zn involve a triple-layered solution consisting of a methanol solution of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, methanol, and a CHCl3 or PhNO2 solution of hexapyridylsumanene (HexP, 2) at 20 °C under air. For 2-Cd, the conditions involve a triple-layered solution of a methanol solution of Cd(NO3)2·4H2O, methanol, and a PhCl solution of HexP (2) at 20 °C under air.",

      "question": "What is the role of hexapyridylsumanene (HexP, 2) in the formation of porous coordination networks?",
      "answer": "Hexapyridylsumanene (HexP, 2) acts as a ligand that, through metal coordination with Zn(NO3)2·6H2O or Cd(NO3)2·4H2O, forms the porous coordination networks 2-Zn and 2-Cd, reflecting the curved structure of the sumanene skeleton and resulting in large confined spaces with small open windows.",

    {
      "question": "What structural feature is unique to the hexapyridylsumanene (HexP, 2) ligand in the formation of the networks?",
      "answer": "The unique feature of hexapyridylsumanene (HexP, 2) in the formation of the networks is its flexibility, which allows it to change its bond length and angles depending on the structural requirements for the network formations, facilitating the formation of large confined spaces with small apertures.",

    {
      "question": "How does the synthesis method differ between 2-Zn and 2-Cd networks?",
      "answer": "The synthesis method differs in the choice of metal salt and solvent used for the bottom layer in the triple-layered solution. For 2-Zn, Zn(NO3)2·6H2O in methanol and CHCl3 or PhNO2 are used, while for 2-Cd, Cd(NO3)2·4H2O in methanol and PhCl are used.",

    {
      "question": "What is the impact of the curved structure of the sumanene skeleton on the formation of the networks?",
      "answer": "The curved structure of the sumanene skeleton impacts the formation of the networks by contributing to the formation of large confined spaces with small apertures, as it allows for the flexible adjustment of the ligand's structure to meet the requirements for network formation.",

      "question": "How does the presence of air affect the synthesis of 2-Zn and 2-Cd networks?",
      "answer": "The presence of air during the synthesis of 2-Zn and 2-Cd networks is necessary as it likely influences the oxidation state of the metal ions and the overall reaction environment, facilitating the successful formation of the porous coordination networks.",

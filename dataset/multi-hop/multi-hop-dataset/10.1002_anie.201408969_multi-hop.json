      "question": "Why does polymorph 14-b not show a noticeable yellow emission like 14-a?",
      "answer": "Polymorph 14-b does not show a noticeable yellow emission like 14-a because the presence of TMB in its generation leads to the scavenging of radical species, resulting in fewer lattice defects compared to 14-a.",

    {
      "question": "How does the 'mesitylene strategy' contribute to the discovery of new optical properties in NTHU-14?",
      "answer": "The 'mesitylene strategy' contributes by leading to the formation of polymorphic phases, which possess distinct optical properties due to their nonidentical structures.",

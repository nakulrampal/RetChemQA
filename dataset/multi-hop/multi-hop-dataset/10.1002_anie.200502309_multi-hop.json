    },
    {
      "question": "How does the removal of water molecules affect the crystal volume and channel volumes?",

      "question": "What is the effect of heating the single crystals to 150 8C for 1 day?",
      "answer": "Heating the single crystals to 150 8C for 1 day results in the removal of approximately three water molecules from the pores per formula unit, forming structure 2.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What causes the color change observed during the dehydration/rehydration process?",

    {
      "question": "How does the synthesis of the framework material involve the use of ppca?",
      "answer": "The synthesis involves using ppca as a ligand that functions in a m3-bridging mode, linking cobalt atoms into a 2D array and contributing to the formation of the 3D porous framework.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does the removal of the coordinated water molecule from Co2 affect the framework?",
      "answer": "The removal of the coordinated water molecule from Co2 allows a shear motion that brings the channel walls closer together, leading to a significant decrease in volume.",

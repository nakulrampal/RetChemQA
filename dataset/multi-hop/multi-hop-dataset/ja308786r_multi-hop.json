    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the PXRD patterns of SALEM-2 before and after catalysis?",
      "answer": "The PXRD patterns indicate that SALEM-2 retains its crystallinity after being used as a Brønsted-base catalyst.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What does the TGA curve for SALEM-2 suggest about its thermal stability?",

    {
      "question": "What molecules can SALEM-2 admit and release, based on TGA–MS data, that ZIF-8 cannot?",
      "answer": "SALEM-2 can admit and release cyclohexane and toluene, which ZIF-8 cannot.",

      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What does the reverse SALE experiment demonstrate about the reversibility of the SALE process?",
      "answer": "The reverse SALE experiment demonstrates that up to 80% of the im linkers of SALEM-2 can be replaced back with mim linkers, retaining the SOD topology.",

      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What does the presence of residual electron density near imidazolate C2 atoms in SALEM-2 suggest?",
      "answer": "It suggests the presence of mim linkers in the crystal structure of SALEM-2, indicating that the SALE process does not achieve 100% exchange of mim to im.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"

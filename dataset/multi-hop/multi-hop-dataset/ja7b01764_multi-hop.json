      "question": "What are the synthesis conditions for [Cu2(glu)2(bpa)]n·2.4H2O (1a)?",
      "answer": "Cu(NO3)2 (1 mmol), glutaric acid (1 mmol), and 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethane (bpa, 0.5 mmol) were mixed in 100 ml H2O. 1 molar eqv. of NaOH was added dropwise with swirling to prevent precipitation. The blue solution was placed in an oven preheated to 80 °C. Green block shaped crystals were obtained after 24 – 48 hours.",

      "type": "Factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What method was used to obtain the activated phase of the MOFs?",
      "answer": "The newly synthesized MOF crystals were exposed to supercritical CO2 (scCO2) for 24 hours to obtain the apohost or activated phase.",

      "type": "Factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the inversion of the gauche torsion angles in the phase change of MOFs?",
      "answer": "The inversion of the gauche torsion angles signifies an enantiomeric conformational change in the glutarate moieties, which is crucial for the observed phase change in each MOF.",

      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What computational method was used to investigate the phase transition mechanism in the MOFs?",
      "answer": "Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations and Molecular Mechanics (MM) simulations were used to investigate the phase transition mechanism.",

      "type": "Factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the phase change affect the solvent-accessible volume in MOF 1?",
      "answer": "The phase change results in a large decrease by 44% in the solvent-accessible volume during the conversion of MOF 1 from the wide-channel form (520 Å3) to the narrow-channel form (281 Å3).",
      "difficulty": "Medium",
      "type": "Reasoning"

    {
      "question": "True or False: The activated MOF 1' shows a gate-opening event at 4 bar CO2 gas pressure, transitioning from the narrow-channel form to the wide-channel form.",

      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role do the flexible bipyridyl ligands play in the phase transition of the MOFs?",
      "answer": "The flexible bipyridyl ligands are crucial in accommodating the variations in the Cu–glu paddlewheel orientation, thus allowing the conformational change and phase transition to occur.",

    {
      "question": "True or False: The energy barriers for the direct gauche-to-gauche interconversion are significantly lower than those for the trans route in both MOFs 1 and 2.",

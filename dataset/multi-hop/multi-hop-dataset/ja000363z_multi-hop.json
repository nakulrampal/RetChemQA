      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the free volume in MOF-9 compare to other interpenetrating networks?",
      "answer": "MOF-9 has a free volume of 71% of the crystal volume, which is unobserved for interpenetrating networks that generally incorporate either very little or no free volume.",

    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the Tb2C6O12 cluster SBUs in the structure of MOF-9?",
      "answer": "The Tb2C6O12 cluster SBUs serve as octahedral C6 units that are joined by long struts to give a 3-D structure having two identical interpenetrating frameworks, which contributes to the large free volume in MOF-9.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What was the purpose of using secondary building units (SBUs) in the synthesis of MOF-9?",
      "answer": "The purpose of using SBUs was to achieve stable, highly porous, and functionalized open networks.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the presence of large free volume in MOF-9 affect its potential applications?",
      "answer": "The large free volume in MOF-9 suggests it could be highly effective for gas storage, separation, or as a catalyst due to the increased space available for guest molecules.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why was DMSO chosen for the solvent exchange experiments with MOF-9?",
      "answer": "DMSO was chosen for solvent exchange experiments because it was originally used in the synthesis and its molecules occupy the void space in MOF-9, making it suitable for studying reversible exchange.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What does the TG analysis reveal about the stability of MOF-9?",
      "answer": "The TG analysis reveals that MOF-9 shows a weight loss corresponding to the loss of 20 DMSO molecules per formula unit, indicating the liberation of all guest molecules in the channels and suggesting framework stability to reversible exchange of DMSO guests.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the size of SBUs influence the free volume in interpenetrating structures like MOF-9?",
      "answer": "The size of SBUs influences the free volume by determining the degree of interpenetration; larger SBUs lead to a larger free volume due to the inability to fit more interpenetrating frameworks within the available space.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does the linker length play in the structure of interpenetrating networks?",
      "answer": "The length of linkers largely determines the level of interpenetration in the structure, with longer linkers potentially allowing for less dense packing and thus more free volume.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the structure of MOF-9 maximally interpenetrated?",
      "answer": "False, the structure of MOF-9 is not maximally interpenetrated due to the large size of SBUs preventing further interpenetration.",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "Does MOF-9 have a cubic structure?",
      "answer": "False, MOF-9 does not have a strictly cubic structure, but its analysis was qualitatively demonstrated using a cubic system for simplicity.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can MOF-9's framework accommodate a third interpenetrating framework?",
      "answer": "False, the size of the SBUs in MOF-9 is too large to allow a third interpenetrating framework to form.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the free volume in MOF-9 less than 20% of the crystal volume?",
      "answer": "False, the free volume in MOF-9 is 71% of the crystal volume, which is significantly higher than 20%.",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"

    {
      "question": "Was the synthesis of MOF-9 achieved without the use of secondary building units (SBUs)?",
      "answer": "False, the synthesis of MOF-9 was achieved using secondary building units (SBUs) as a key component.",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "Does the presence of DMSO in MOF-9 contribute to its structural stability?",
      "answer": "True, the presence of DMSO in MOF-9 contributes to its structural stability by occupying the void space and participating in reversible exchange experiments.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the free volume in MOF-9 a result of its non-interpenetrating structure?",
      "answer": "False, the large free volume in MOF-9 is a result of its interpenetrating structure combined with the large size of SBUs.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "True or False"
    }

    {
      "question": "What is the main challenge in determining the exact chemical structure of non-crystallizing natural products?",
      "answer": "The main challenge in determining the exact chemical structure of non-crystallizing natural products is their sensitivity to chemical functionalities, making it difficult to determine their structure through classical synthetic chemistry or controlled degradation.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the metal-organic framework (MOF) described in the study mimic enzyme-like specificity?",
      "answer": "The MOF described in the study mimics enzyme-like specificity by featuring hexagonal pores densely decorated with â€“OH groups, enabling selective hydrolysis of glycosyl bonds without the participation of formal protons, similar to the action of glycosidase enzymes.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role do the densely packed alcohol groups within the MOF play in the hydrolysis of glycosyl bonds?",
      "answer": "The densely packed alcohol groups within the MOF play a crucial role in the hydrolysis of glycosyl bonds by promoting the acidification of adsorbed water, which, in turn, facilitates the selective breaking of glycosyl bonds in a manner akin to retaining hydrolase enzymes.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the MOF capable of determining the absolute configuration of the chiral fragment of a natural product?",
      "answer": "Yes, the MOF is capable of determining the absolute configuration of the chiral fragment of a natural product by encapsulating the released chiral fragment and allowing its structural determination through single-crystal X-ray crystallography.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the MOF's ability to perform glycosyl hydrolysis and structural determination in a single operation?",
      "answer": "The significance of the MOF's ability to perform glycosyl hydrolysis and structural determination in a single operation lies in its potential to simplify the process of determining the absolute configuration of natural products, especially those with sensitive functionalities, without the need for classical synthetic chemistry or controlled degradation.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The MOF described in the study requires the addition of formal protons to catalyze the hydrolysis of glycosyl bonds.",
      "answer": "False",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The MOF's catalytic action is limited to the hydrolysis of glycosyl bonds and cannot encapsulate the released fragments.",
      "answer": "False",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the MOF's catalytic action compare to natural glycoside hydrolases?",
      "answer": "The MOF's catalytic action is similar to retaining glycoside hydrolases, as it involves the combined action of mild acid sites (water) and nucleophile sites (alcohols) in a confined space, leading to the hydrolysis of glycosyl bonds with retention of the starting chirality.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The MOF can only hydrolyze glycosyl bonds in natural products that are already crystalline.",
      "answer": "False",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What potential applications does the MOF-driven methodology have beyond the structural characterization of natural products?",
      "answer": "The MOF-driven methodology has potential applications in designing extremely mild metal-free solid-catalyzed processes without formal acid protons, and in the MOF-driven synthesis and stabilization of catalytically active metal species in confined spaces.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"

      "question": "How does the magnetic behavior of [Cu(tzc)(dpp)]n·2H2O (4) change upon heating and cooling?",
      "answer": "Upon heating, [Cu(tzc)(dpp)]n·2H2O (4) undergoes phase transitions to form anhydrous modifications [Cu(tzc)(dpp)]n (6I, 6II, and 6III), showing a switch from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic behavior. This change is reversible upon cooling and rehydration.",

      "question": "What is the role of the tzc ligand in the magnetic properties of [Cu(tzc)(dpp)]n-based compounds?",
      "answer": "The tzc ligand acts as a bridging ligand between Cu(II) centers, mediating magnetic exchange interactions. Its orientation and alignment significantly affect the magnitude of these interactions, leading to changes in the magnetic properties of the compounds.",

      "answer": "In [Cu(tzc)(dpp)]n·1.25hexane (3), the coordination position of one tzc and one dpp ligand is exchanged for one of the Cu(II) cations, leading to a helix-like chain arrangement, which is different from the linear chain arrangement found in other compounds in the series.",

      "answer": "The Cu–Ntzc–Ctzc angle significantly affects the strength of magnetic exchange interactions mediated by the tzc ligand. Angles in the range of 106–114° lead to weak ferromagnetic interactions, while angles slightly above 115° result in antiferromagnetic interactions.",

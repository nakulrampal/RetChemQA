      "question": "What is the main goal of synthesizing metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with high stability?",
      "answer": "The main goal of synthesizing MOFs with high stability is due to the sustainability requirement for practical applications, including gas storage, separations, carbon capture, and catalysis.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why has it been difficult to synthesize chemically ultra-stable, highly porous MOFs in the form of crystalline solids, especially as single crystals?",
      "answer": "It has been difficult because the conventional one-pot synthesis route makes it challenging to control the metal-containing nodes and therefore the topology of the MOF, leading to unpredictable in situ formation of inorganic building blocks, mixed phases, and often polycrystalline or amorphous products.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the kinetically tuned dimensional augmentation strategy used for in the synthesis of MOFs?",
      "answer": "The kinetically tuned dimensional augmentation strategy is used for the synthesis of highly crystalline and extremely robust MOFs with a preserved metal cluster core, by tuning the synthetic conditions to promote the flux of ligands on and off a metal cluster, facilitating defect reparation and structure reorganization.",

    {
      "question": "What makes PCN-250(Fe2Co) stand out among other synthesized MOFs in terms of gas storage?",
      "answer": "PCN-250(Fe2Co) stands out because it exhibits not only one of the highest total CH4 uptakes of 200 V STP/V at 35 bar and 298 K but also one of the highest total H2 volumetric uptakes of 60 g L^-1 at 40 bar and 77 K, along with extraordinary chemical stability.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The synthesis of MOFs with preformed inorganic building blocks eliminates the interference from side reactions generating different inorganic building blocks, making the synthesis of mixed ligand MOFs more challenging.",
      "answer": "False",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the kinetically tuned dimensional augmentation strategy affect the synthesis of MOFs with mixed ligands?",
      "answer": "The strategy allows for easier synthesis of mixed ligand MOFs by eliminating interference from side reactions generating different inorganic building blocks, thus enabling the growth of single crystals instead of powders.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does acetic acid play in the kinetically tuned dimensional augmentation strategy for MOF synthesis?",
      "answer": "Acetic acid acts as a competing reagent that can slow the rate of bridging ligand attachment by increasing its concentration, facilitating the crystallization process by tuning both ligand substitution and dissociation processes.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The structure of the [Fe2M(m3-O)] building block is not maintained in the synthesized Fe-MOFs using the kinetically tuned dimensional augmentation strategy.",
      "answer": "False",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the kinetically tuned dimensional augmentation strategy in controlling the synthesis conditions of Fe-MOFs?",
      "answer": "The significance lies in its ability to control the ligand substitution and dissociation balance by adding extra competing reagent, such as acetic acid, which allows for the synthesis of large single crystals of Fe-MOFs with desired structural features and stability.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What challenges does the conventional one-pot synthesis route present in the synthesis of MOFs, and how does the kinetically tuned dimensional augmentation strategy overcome these challenges?",
      "answer": "The conventional one-pot synthesis route presents challenges such as unpredictable in situ formation of inorganic building blocks, mixed phases, and polycrystalline or amorphous products. The kinetically tuned dimensional augmentation strategy overcomes these by using preformed metal clusters and tuning the synthesis conditions to promote controlled ligand substitution, leading to the synthesis of highly crystalline and stable MOFs.",

      "question": "What are the synthesis conditions for NAU3?",
      "answer": "A mixture of bte (0.062 g, 0.30 mmol), Cu(CH3COO)2·H2O (0.060 g, 0.30 mmol), (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O (0.12 g, 0.10 mmol) and water (7.0 mL) was adjusted to pH = 4.5. The mixture was placed in a Teflon reactor (20 mL) and heated at 150°C for 72 hours. The mixture was then cooled down to room temperature at a rate of 10°C h−1, and the orange block crystals of NAU3 were obtained with a yield of 52%.",

      "question": "What is the initial and reversible capacity of NAU3 at a current density of 100 mA g−1?",
      "answer": "NAU3 shows a high initial and reversible capacity of 1406.4 and 575.8 mA h g−1 at the current density of 100 mA g−1.",

      "question": "How does the structure of NAU4 differ from NAU3 in terms of polyoxometalate anions?",
      "answer": "NAU4 uses phosphotungstic acid instead of (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O used in NAU3, resulting in the formation of yellow block crystals of NAU4 with a yield of 45%.",

      "question": "What are the main factors attributed to the electrochemical performances of NAU3–6 as anode materials in lithium ion batteries?",
      "answer": "The electrochemical performances are mainly attributed to the redox properties of the POM cluster anions, coordinated metals centers (Cu+ and Zn2+), and coordination ability between azacycle and Li+ characterized by the CV, EIS, XPS, XRD, ATR-FT-IR and SEM measurements.",

    {
      "question": "What role does the crystal structure and retention rate of original morphology play in the lithium ion battery performance of POMOFs?",
      "answer": "The crystal structure and retention rate of original morphology can partly dominate the diffusion of Li-ion and lithiation/delithiation processes, and further affect the capacitive performance. Suitable pathway and structural features of dimensions, supramolecular interactions and stabilities should be furnished the diffusion of Li-ions and Li reaction site requirements to give satisfying consequences.",

      "question": "What is the effect of coordinative competition on the capacitive performance of NAU3 and NAU4?",
      "answer": "Coordinative competition occurred in the presence of Van der Waals' forces can affect the capacitive performance. For NAU3, it makes the partial N sites coordinated with Li+ ions and increases the Li storage performance. Similarly, in NAU4, the competition between Li+ and Cu+ ions, especially at the Cu···O positions, affects the capacitive performance.",

      "question": "What is the significance of the 3D supramolecular network and 2D supramolecular layer in NAU3 and NAU4 for lithium ion battery performance?",
      "answer": "The 3D supramolecular network and 2D supramolecular layer in NAU3 and NAU4 are believed to be efficient for the diffusion of Li-ions due to their enough space and exposed active sites, which benefits the lithium ion battery performance.",

      "question": "How does the special 1D folded chains in NAU5 and NAU6 contribute to their lithium ion storage performances?",
      "answer": "The special 1D folded chains in NAU5 and NAU6 allow Li-ion to be embedded between the adjacent uncoordinated triazole N atoms, forming stable Li-N forces. This contributes to the enhancement of the capacity in NAU6 compared to NAU5.",

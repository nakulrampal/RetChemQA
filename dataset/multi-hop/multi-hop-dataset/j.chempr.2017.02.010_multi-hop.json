      "question": "What is the general method used for synthesizing Ln-PCM-22 materials?",
      "answer": "All Ln-PCM-22 materials were synthesized by reacting tris(p-carboxylato)triphenylphosphine with lanthanide(III) nitrate hydrate precursors in a DMF/dioxane/H2O mixture, followed by heating at 80°C for 3-4 days.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How were the as-synthesized Ln-PCM-22 materials activated for trace water analysis?",
      "answer": "The as-synthesized Ln-PCM-22 materials were activated by heating at 100°C under vacuum for 18 hours.",

      "question": "What was the purpose of using ICP-MS in the study of mixed Ln-PCM-22 materials?",
      "answer": "ICP-MS was used to monitor the parts-per-billion concentration and relative molar ratios of Eu, Gd, and Tb in all mixed PCM-22 systems, ensuring the correct proportions of lanthanides were incorporated.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How was the hydration number (q) for Tb-PCM-22 determined?",
      "answer": "The hydration number (q) was determined by comparing the emissive lifetimes of Tb-PCM-22 synthesized in H2O and D2O, using the constant and equation provided by Bünzli.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What was observed when desolvated samples of Eu:Tb-PCM-22 were resolvated with individual components of the mother liquor?",
      "answer": "Upon resolvation with individual components of the mother liquor, unique emission profiles and visually distinguishable colors were obtained for each solvent, indicating different interactions with the PCM-22 material.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What was the result of exposing desolvated Eu:Gd:Tb-PCM-22 materials to 18 common solvents?",
      "answer": "Exposing desolvated Eu:Gd:Tb-PCM-22 materials to 18 common solvents resulted in unique eight-factor fingerprint profiles for each solvent, demonstrating the material's capability for rapid solvent identification.",

    {
      "question": "True or False: The study demonstrated that Ln-PCM-22 materials could detect trace H2O in D2O in the range of 10–120,000 ppm.",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"

      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What was the significance of the 'eight-factor' fingerprint in the context of solvent sensing?",
      "answer": "The 'eight-factor' fingerprint was significant because it provided a spectroscopically unique profile for each solvent tested, allowing for the rapid and internally calibrated identification of solvents based on their emission characteristics.",

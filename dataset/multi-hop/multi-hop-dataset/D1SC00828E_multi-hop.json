      "question": "How does the incorporation of different molecular sizes and coordination modes of H3TCA and NPy3 enhance the coordination polymer?",
      "answer": "Incorporating H3TCA and NPy3 enhances the chemical and thermal stability of the polymers, diminishes structural relaxation during the catalytic process, and optimizes the Ar3N moieties into special structural intermediates.",

    {
      "question": "What role does the oxidized state of Ar3N in the coordination polymer play in the C(sp3)–H arylation process?",
      "answer": "The oxidized state of Ar3N in the coordination polymer acts as a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) catalyst, selectively abstracting a hydrogen atom from C(sp3)–H nucleophiles to enable the formation of the C(sp3)c radical and the cross-coupling reaction.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"

      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the mixed-ligand approach in the design of the coordination polymer?",
      "answer": "The mixed-ligand approach improves the photochemical and photophysical properties, providing important insight into the rational design and optimization of recyclable photocatalysts for rapid access to complex bioactive molecules and late-stage functionalized pharmaceuticals.",

    {
      "question": "What experimental technique was used to confirm the adsorption of substrates within the pores of the coordination polymer?",
      "answer": "1H NMR and IR spectroscopy were used to confirm the adsorption of substrates within the pores of the coordination polymer.",

    {
      "question": "What is the role of the special structural intermediate formed by the NPy3 ligand in the coordination polymer?",
      "answer": "The special structural intermediate formed by the NPy3 ligand decreases the potential structural relaxation during the HAT process, facilitating the transformation from Ar3Nc+ to Ar3NH+ to abstract a hydrogen atom at the most electron-rich site of C(sp3)–H nucleophiles.",

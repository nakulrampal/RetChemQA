    {
      "question": "Is CTH-17 chemically stable in water at pH 7?",
      "answer": "Yes, CTH-17 is stable in water at pH 7 for at least 1 hour as the corresponding PXRD pattern remains the same as the as-synthesized products albeit with peak broadening.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "Does the thermal stability assessment of CTH-17 indicate it is stable up to 800 °C?",

      "question": "What is the general procedure for the oxidative hydroxylation of arylboronic acids into phenols using JNU-204 as a photocatalyst?",
      "answer": "A solution of arylboronic acid, Et3N, JNU-204 in CH3CN/H2O (4:1) is stirred under 30W blue LED for 48 hours at room temperature. After completion, the solvent is evaporated, and the crude residue is purified by flash column chromatography to afford the phenol product.",

    {
      "question": "How is the stability of JNU-204 tested in different solvents and pH conditions?",
      "answer": "The stability of JNU-204 is tested by treating it with different organic solvents and aqueous solutions at different pH values, followed by comparing the PXRD patterns before and after treatment.",

      "question": "What is the role of N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) in the photocatalytic oxidation/[3+2] cycloaddition/oxidative aromatization reaction using JNU-204?",
      "answer": "N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) is added to the reaction mixture after the initial photocatalytic oxidation/[3+2] cycloaddition under blue LED irradiation. NBS likely serves as a brominating agent that facilitates the oxidative aromatization step, leading to the formation of the final N-heterocyclic product.",

      "question": "What experimental evidence supports the involvement of superoxide radical anion (O2•−) in the photocatalytic hydroxylation of arylboronic acids using JNU-204?",
      "answer": "The involvement of superoxide radical anion (O2•−) is supported by mechanistic studies where the reaction yield significantly decreases in the presence of 1,4-benzoquinone (BQ), a known O2•− quencher, indicating that O2•− is a key intermediate in the reaction.",

      "question": "What is the significance of the wuk topology in the structure of JNU-204?",
      "answer": "The wuk topology in JNU-204's structure signifies a unique arrangement of its metal-organic framework, characterized by a 6-c net with a minimal transitivity, which contributes to its exceptional stability, porosity, and photocatalytic properties.",

      "question": "True or False: The photocatalytic oxidation of enamines using JNU-204 involves a radical pathway.",
      "answer": "False. The photocatalytic oxidation of enamines using JNU-204 involves singlet oxygen (1O2) as the reactive oxygen species, as indicated by the significant decrease in yield when a known 1O2 quencher (DABCO) is used, ruling out a radical pathway.",

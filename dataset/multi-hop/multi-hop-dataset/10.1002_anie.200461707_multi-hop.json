    {
      "question": "What is the role of the longer N-oxide axle in the structure of the metal-organic frameworks?",

    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the [2]rotaxane's ability to fit through the pores of the metal-organic frameworks?",
      "answer": "It indicates that interpenetration of these rotaxane nets is a possibility since the openings created are large enough for these uncommonly 'wide' ligands.",

    },
    {
      "question": "Why was a three-dimensional (3D) network not possible with the original dipyridinium ligand?",

      "question": "What does the presence of a chloride ion in the structures of compounds 3-7 indicate?",
      "answer": "It is attributed to small amounts of this anion in the bulk sample of axle 12+ since during work up 12+ is subjected to column chromatography in which one of the solvents is aqueous NH4Cl before anion exchange to OTf.",

      "question": "What does the planar tessellation of a five-coordinate node into a 2D network in the structure of compound 7 demonstrate?",
      "answer": "It demonstrates that each N-oxide ligand can 'bend' at the Yb-O-N linkage, resulting in a [3/4,5] net comprising alternating triangles and squares linked through five-connected nodes.",

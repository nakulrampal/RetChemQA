      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What was the role of dTPDC in the mixed-linker MOFs?",
      "answer": "dTPDC acted as a nonemissive linker to increase the distances between the emissive linkers, effectively reducing the nonradiative decay channels caused by aggregation.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Was the synthesis of UiO-68-L/dTPDC carried out at 120Â°C?",

      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Was the UV-vis absorption spectrum of UiO-68-dTPDC weaker and narrower in the visible-light range compared to UiO-68-NTMB?",

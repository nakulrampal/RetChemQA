      "question": "How does the pore environment and topology of the MOF supports affect the catalytic activity of the deposited molybdenum(VI) catalysts?",
      "answer": "The varied pore environments and MOF topologies result in different binding locations and coordination modes of the introduced Mo species, which in turn lead to different structural evolutions of the Mo binding motifs during cyclohexene epoxidation, affecting the catalytic activity and selectivity.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What method was used to synthesize the Mo-supported catalysts in the study?",
      "answer": "The Mo-supported catalysts were synthesized using a solvothermal deposition in MOFs (SIM) method.",

    {
      "question": "True or False: The study's findings highlight the importance of MOF supports to modulate the chemical environments of deposited metal species, impacting metal installation and leading to structural evolution during catalytic reactions.",

      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What was the outcome of the hot filtration tests conducted in the study?",
      "answer": "The hot filtration tests indicated that the catalytic reactions were arrested due to no active Mo species leaching into the solutions, demonstrating the heterogeneous catalytic nature of the three Mo-based catalysts.",

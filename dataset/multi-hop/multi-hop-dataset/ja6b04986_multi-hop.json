      "question": "What is the role of α-cyclodextrin (α-CD) in the co-precipitation process for gold recovery?",
      "answer": "α-cyclodextrin (α-CD) facilitates the co-precipitation process for gold recovery by forming stable 2:1 second-sphere crystalline adducts with square-planar [AuX4]− anions, stabilized by multiple [C–H···X–Au] interactions between the anions and the primary faces of two CD tori.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does the size of the CD torus influence the co-precipitation of MAuX4 salts?",
      "answer": "The size of the CD torus influences the co-precipitation of MAuX4 salts by determining the orientation of the [AuX4]− anions within the cavities between the CD tori. Larger CD tori result in more tilted orientations of the anions, limiting their ability to serve as steric matching linkers for the formation of compact solid-state superstructures necessary for co-precipitation.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What factors determine the spontaneous co-precipitation of CD with MAuX4 salts?",
      "answer": "The spontaneous co-precipitation of CD with MAuX4 salts is determined by the stereo-electronic fit between [AuX4]− anions and the CD torus, facilitating the formation of stable second-sphere coordination adducts, and the bridging by alkali metal cations.",

    },
    {
      "question": "Why does α-CD with KAuBr4 have the highest co-precipitation yield among the tested combinations?",
      "answer": "α-CD with KAuBr4 has the highest co-precipitation yield due to its unique 1D cable-like superstructure, consisting of an infinite array of [K(OH2)6]+ and [AuBr4]− arranged alternately in ion wires encapsulated by α-CD tori, driven by cooperative dual second-sphere coordination.",

    {
      "question": "How does the molar ratio of KAuBr4 to α-CD affect the yield of the co-precipitated α·K·Br adduct?",
      "answer": "Increasing the amount of α-CD after reaching a 1:2 molar ratio of KAuBr4 to α-CD does not enhance the yield of the co-precipitated α·K·Br adduct, indicating that the co-precipitated adduct has a constant composition of 1:2 for KAuBr4 to α-CD.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the effect of temperature on the co-precipitation yield of α·K·Br?",
      "answer": "Lowering the crystallization temperature from 20 to 0 °C increases the yields of the co-precipitated α·K·Br from 78 to 94%, indicating that lower temperatures lead to more efficient co-precipitation processes.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What does the 1H NMR titration reveal about the assembly between α-CD and KAuBr4?",
      "answer": "The 1H NMR titration reveals that, despite changing the molar ratios of KAuBr4 to α-CD, no significant alterations in the chemical shifts of the protons on α-CD were evident, indicating that any assembly between α-CD and [AuBr4]− cannot be detected by 1H NMR spectroscopy at the tested concentration ranges and molar ratios.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does the presence of KAuBr4 affect the aggregation state of α-CD in aqueous solution according to DOSY NMR spectroscopy?",
      "answer": "DOSY NMR spectroscopy shows identical diffusion coefficients for a saturated solution of α·K·Br and a solution of α-CD at the same concentration, suggesting that the presence of KAuBr4 does not lead to changes in the aggregation state of α-CD in the aqueous solution phase.",

      "question": "True or False: The co-precipitation of α-CD and KAuBr4 could be the result of cooperative crystallization triggered by synergetic second-sphere coordination.",

      "question": "True or False: Increasing the concentration of α-CD beyond a 1:2 molar ratio with KAuBr4 significantly enhances the yield of the co-precipitated α·K·Br adduct.",

    {
      "question": "What is the relationship between the synthesis conditions and the magnetic properties of the three complexes?",
      "answer": "The synthesis conditions, particularly the choice of crystallization solvent, determine the structural topology of the complexes, which in turn influences their magnetic properties, such as antiferromagnetic coupling and the presence of spin canting.",

    {
      "question": "How does the presence of DMSO and DMF molecules in complexes 2 and 3, respectively, affect their structures?",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why are the complexes synthesized in this study ideal candidates for studying magnetic frustration?",
      "answer": "Due to their geometrically frustrated lattice structures, such as the Kagomé layer, which cannot gain magnetic ordering even at zero temperature because of strong quantum fluctuations.",

      "question": "What challenges are associated with the preparation of Kagomé-type coordination networks, and how does this study address them?",
      "answer": "The preparation of Kagomé-type coordination networks with strong antiferromagnetically coupled spins is challenging, but this study successfully addresses these challenges by synthesizing a new example of a Kagomé-type coordination network using Co2+ ions and azido ligands.",

    {
      "question": "What potential safety concerns are associated with the synthesis of these complexes, and how are they mitigated?",
      "answer": "Azide salts, used in the synthesis, are potentially explosive, but safety concerns are mitigated by preparing only small amounts of materials and handling them with care.",

      "question": "What is the role of water in the synthesis of UiO-67 and MIL-140C?",
      "answer": "The amount of water plays a crucial role in the synthesis of UiO-67 and MIL-140C, affecting the formation of pure phases or mixtures. For UiO-67, water acts as a structure-driving agent, influencing the formation of defect-free crystals. In the synthesis of MIL-140C, varying the amount of water leads to the formation of either pure MIL-140C or mixtures of UiO-67 and MIL-140C, indicating that water content can dictate the phase purity and the coexistence of different MOFs.",

      "question": "How does the synthesis condition affect the morphology of UiO-67 and MIL-140C?",
      "answer": "The synthesis condition, particularly the amount of water added, significantly affects the morphology of UiO-67 and MIL-140C. Pure UiO-67 exhibits octahedral morphology, while pure MIL-140C shows plate-like morphology. When synthesized under conditions leading to a mixture of both MOFs, the resulting sample displays morphologies characteristic of both UiO-67 and MIL-140C, indicating that synthesis conditions can control the morphological features of the MOFs.",

      "question": "What techniques were used for the structural analysis of UiO-67 and MIL-140C?",
      "answer": "The structural analysis of UiO-67 and MIL-140C involved several techniques, including continuous rotation electron diffraction (cRED) for data collection, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) for phase identification, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for morphology observation, and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) for understanding the dynamics and chemical environment within the MOFs.",

      "question": "What is the significance of the thermal ellipsoid model in the analysis of UiO-67?",
      "answer": "The thermal ellipsoid model is significant in the analysis of UiO-67 as it represents the probability of atomic positions and can reveal molecular motions within the framework. By comparing the thermal ellipsoids obtained from cRED data and those calculated from molecular dynamics simulations, researchers can validate the accuracy of structural determination and gain insights into the dynamic behavior of linker molecules in UiO-67.",

      "question": "How does temperature affect the anisotropic displacement parameters (ADPs) in MIL-140C?",
      "answer": "Temperature affects the anisotropic displacement parameters (ADPs) in MIL-140C by influencing the extent of atomic displacements. The study showed that despite the change in temperature from room temperature (298 K) to cryogenic temperature (98 K), there were no significant changes in the eigenvalues of the ADPs, suggesting that the overall rigid behavior of the framework is maintained across different temperatures. However, the larger λ1 values for nonaxial carbon atoms in linker 1 compared to those in linker 2 at both temperatures confirm the more ordered and less mobile nature of linker 2.",

      "question": "What does the presence of spinning sidebands in the 1H-13C CPMAS NMR spectrum of MIL-140C indicate?",
      "answer": "The presence of spinning sidebands in the 1H-13C CPMAS NMR spectrum of MIL-140C indicates the existence of chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) patterns, which provide insights into the dynamics and motion of the linkers within the framework. The asymmetric CSA pattern observed suggests that the carbon atoms in the phenyl groups of the bpdc linkers have restricted motion, implying the absence of π-flips and the presence of librational motions at room temperature.",

    {
      "question": "What challenges are associated with the structural determination of MIL-140C using cRED data?",
      "answer": "The structural determination of MIL-140C using cRED data faced challenges such as the preferred orientation of the crystals, which led to missing reflections in the data. To mitigate this, data were collected and merged from crystals in different orientations. Additionally, the refinement process required the application of soft geometrical restraints and the consideration of dynamical effects that cause deviations from kinematic intensities, leading to relatively high R1 values.",

      "question": "How does the synthesis of UiO-67 with varying water content influence its phase purity?",
      "answer": "The synthesis of UiO-67 with varying water content significantly influences its phase purity. Pure UiO-67 is obtained with no water added, while the addition of intermediate amounts of water results in mixtures of UiO-67 and MIL-140C. This indicates that water content is a critical factor in determining the phase outcome of the synthesis, with specific water amounts leading to the coexistence of different MOFs.",

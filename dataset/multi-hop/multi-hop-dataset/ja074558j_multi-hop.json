      "answer": "The structural feature highlighted by the presence of Mg12 cages in [Mg2(Hcam)3·3H2O]·NO3·MeCN, 1 is the formation of a body-centered cubic (bcu) MOF composed of vertex-shared cages, which is an unusual example of a body-centered cubic MOF.",

      "answer": "The presence of the [Mg2(Hcam)3]+ SBU in solution suggests that the solid-state assembly process for [Mg2(Hcam)3·3H2O]·NO3·MeCN, 1 involves the participation of soluble [Mg2(Hcam)3]+ SBUs, which likely associate using neutral carboxylates as linkers, promoted by the formation of strong hydrogen bonding interactions.",

      "question": "What role does hydrogen bonding play in the assembly of [Mg2(Hcam)3·3H2O]·NO3·MeCN, 1?",
      "answer": "Hydrogen bonding plays a crucial role in promoting the association of the 3-fold [Mg2(Hcam)3]+ paddle-wheel SBUs through neutral carboxylates as linkers, and it possibly aids in stabilizing the unusual structure by contributing to the formation of water-filled 0D cavities within the Mg12 cages.",

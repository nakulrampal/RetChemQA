      "question": "How does the temperature affect the O2 adsorption behavior in Fe2(dobdc)?",
      "answer": "The temperature affects the O2 adsorption behavior in Fe2(dobdc) by determining the mode of O2 binding to the iron sites. At low temperatures, O2 binds in a reversible manner, while at higher temperatures, a thermal activation barrier is overcome, leading to the formation of iron(III)-peroxide species and irreversible O2 adsorption.",

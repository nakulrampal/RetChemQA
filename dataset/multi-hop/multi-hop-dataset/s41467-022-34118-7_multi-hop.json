      "question": "What is the significance of the synthesis of bimetallic OMCs via selective metal metathesis and oxidation transformation?",
      "answer": "The synthesis of bimetallic OMCs via selective metal metathesis and oxidation transformation is significant because it represents the first family of bimetallic OMCs synthesized through this method. These materials exhibit unusual structural topologies and tailor-made functionalities, opening new avenues for the design of bimetallic OMCs and providing an attractive platform for exploring exotic states of matter.",

      "question": "How does the oxidation process affect the chemical state of the ligand moieties in the synthesized bimetallic OMCs?",
      "answer": "The oxidation process affects the chemical state of the ligand moieties in the synthesized bimetallic OMCs by inducing charge redistribution or delocalization from the ligand to the metal moieties. This results in a change in the oxidation state of the ligand moieties, contributing to the formation of a Cu(I)-based OMC with altered electronic properties.",

      "question": "What role do ammonium salts play in the mechanochemical synthesis of ZIFs?",
      "answer": "Ammonium salts facilitate the otherwise inefficient reaction of imidazoles with ZnO, enabling topologically selective ZIF synthesis.",

    {
      "question": "What was the outcome of grinding ZnO and HIm without any liquid or salt additives?",

      "question": "What was the effect of using DEF as a grinding liquid in the presence of ammonium salts?",
      "answer": "Using DEF as a grinding liquid in the presence of ammonium salts led to the formation of an open structure with the nog topology or an unidentified product that transformed into the nog framework upon aging.",

      "question": "How did the product topology vary with the type of ligand used in the synthesis?",
      "answer": "The product topology varied with the ligand, for example, reactions with HMeIm consistently yielded the SOD topology ZIF-8, while the topology for HEtIm varied depending on the salt and liquid used.",

    {
      "question": "What was the significance of the observed development of topologies in the presence of NH4NO3?",
      "answer": "The development of topologies in the presence of NH4NO3 followed the Ostwald's rule of stages, reflecting an increase in density of tetrahedral sites and a decrease in solvent-accessible volume, indicating a pathway for ion inclusion and control of reactivity.",

      "question": "What was the effect of grinding time on the product topology when using NH4NO3 and HEtIm?",
      "answer": "Grinding for shorter times resulted in a mixture of RHO and ANA topologies, while longer grinding times led to the formation of the close-packed qtz framework.",

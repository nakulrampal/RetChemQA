    {
      "question": "What are the synthesis conditions for the formation of Au2(μ-dppe)2Br2·2(OSMe2)?",
      "answer": "The synthesis involves dissolving (tht)AuBr in dimethyl sulfoxide, filtering the solution, and allowing it to evaporate for a week to grow colorless blocks with an orange luminescence.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the luminescence of type A and type B crystals compare?",
      "answer": "Type A crystals produce similar room-temperature emissions with λmax in the range 640–620 nm, while type B crystals produce emissions centered at 550 nm.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens to the luminescence of type A crystals when exposed to air or vacuum?",
      "answer": "Upon exposure to air or drying in vacuum, crystals of Au2(μ-dppe)2Br2·2(CH2Cl2) and Au2(μ-dppe)2Br2·2(OCMe2) of type A lose their orange emission and acquire a green luminescence.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the effect of acetone vapor on the green luminescent crystals obtained after drying type A crystals?",
      "answer": "Exposure of the solvate-free, green glowing crystals to acetone vapor results in their conversion into orange-glowing crystals.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What structural feature is common among the dimeric complexes in crystals of type A and B?",
      "answer": "The dimeric complexes in crystals of type A and B are all centrosymmetric and share a common ring conformation.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What causes the difference in luminescence between the crystals of type A and B?",
      "answer": "The difference in luminescence between the crystals of type A and B can be ascribed largely to a difference in the Stokes’ shifts, with the green emitting crystals having a lesser Stokes’ shift.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the presence of various solvate molecules influence the structure of Au2(μ-dppe)2Br2 molecules?",
      "answer": "The presence of various solvate molecules influences the structure of Au2(μ-dppe)2Br2 molecules by causing variations in the Au–Br distances and in the Br–Au–P and P–Au–P angles, indicating the molecule's flexibility to accommodate the space available within a particular crystalline environment.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do type C crystals not show variations in luminescence upon drying?",
      "answer": "Type C crystals, which involve polymeric strands rather than discrete dimers, do not show variations in luminescence upon drying because considerable bond breaking and remaking would have to occur to obtain the flexible Au2(μ-dppe)2Br2 molecule from the polymer, which is unlikely to occur in the solid state.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the luminescence change from orange to green upon drying reversible for type A crystals?",
      "answer": "Yes, the luminescence change from orange to green upon drying for type A crystals is reversible, as exposure to acetone or dichloromethane vapor can restore the orange luminescence.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "Do type B crystals change their luminescence when exposed to air or vacuum?",
      "answer": "False, type B crystals do not change their luminescence when exposed to air or vacuum, and they do not show vapoluminescent behavior.",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can the green luminescent phase obtained after drying type A crystals be converted back to orange luminescent phase by exposure to any solvent vapor?",
      "answer": "False, the conversion of the green luminescent phase back to the orange luminescent phase after drying type A crystals is selective, and not all solvent vapors can restore the orange luminescence.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "Are the Au–P distances in the dimeric solvates of type A and B crystals within a narrow range?",
      "answer": "True, the Au–P distances in the dimeric solvates of type A and B crystals fall within a narrow range (2.3032(6) to 2.3238(14) Å).",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "Does the presence of solvate molecules lead to direct interactions such as coordination to gold in the dimeric solvates?",
      "answer": "False, despite the presence of various solvate molecules in the dimeric solvates, there do not appear to be readily identifiable interactions such as coordination to gold between the dimer molecules and the solvate molecules.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"

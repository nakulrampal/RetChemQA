    {
      "question": "What is the main goal of synthesizing chiral porous inorganic materials from chiral porous metal–organic framework precursors?",
      "answer": "The main goal is to transpose the chirality and porosity of the chiral porous metal–organic framework precursors onto the final crystalline inorganic frameworks.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the key structural modifications that occur during the synthesis of chiral porous lanthanide pyrophosphates from MOF precursors?",
      "answer": "The key structural modifications occur primarily at a specific crystallographic site, leading to a single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformation through stages of dehydration, partial decomposition of the ligand, and oxidation, resulting in the transposition of the MOF's topological features onto the final inorganic framework.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The synthesis concept of transposing chirality from MOF precursors to inorganic frameworks can be extended to other chiral porous inorganic solids.",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of the Hhedp ligand in the structure of [Er4(Hhedp)3(H2O)2]?",
      "answer": "The Hhedp ligand acts as an O,O-chelating ligand bridging between two adjacent Er3+ cations, forming a dinuclear trigonal bipyramidal secondary building unit (SBU) and connecting SBUs to form the network.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the adsorption behavior of the final inorganic phase 3 differ from the parent MOF material?",
      "answer": "While the parent MOF material has channels blocked by groups that hinder diffusion, the final inorganic phase 3 has widely accessible channels, showing negligible adsorption for N2, CO2, and CH4 but considerable adsorption for water.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The thermal structural modifications during the synthesis of lanthanide pyrophosphates occur without any modification of the overall network connectivity.",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What topological feature is notable in the structure of [Er4(Hhedp)3(H2O)2] and its transformation products?",
      "answer": "A notable topological feature is the formation of helices parallel to each direction of the unit cell, leading to a three-dimensional interconnected system of helices with an overall srs topology.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What experimental techniques were used to confirm the presence of the [PO3–CHQPO3] ligand in the intermediate phase 2?",
      "answer": "Quantum-chemical calculations on model compounds and Raman spectroscopy were used to confirm the presence of the [PO3–CHQPO3] ligand in the intermediate phase 2.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The adsorption of water by the inorganic phase 3 indicates the absence of permanent pores in the material.",
      "answer": "False",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the chirality transposition from MOF precursors to inorganic frameworks in the context of material synthesis?",
      "answer": "The significance lies in the ability to preserve the chirality and topological features of the MOF precursors in the final inorganic frameworks, potentially extending this synthesis concept to other chiral porous inorganic solids for various applications.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"

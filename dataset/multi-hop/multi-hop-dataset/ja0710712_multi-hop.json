      "question": "What structural feature is responsible for the segregation of layers of the [DAMS+] NLO-phore?",
      "answer": "The segregation of layers of the [DAMS+] NLO-phore is achieved through the formation of a 2D layer containing the inorganic part, formed by infinite 'stripes' of polymeric mixed M(II)/M(III) metal oxalates linked by hydrogen bonds through DAMBA and water molecules.",

    {
      "question": "How does the formation of J aggregates of the [DAMS+] cation affect the SHG properties?",
      "answer": "The formation of J aggregates of the [DAMS+] cation enhances the SHG properties by increasing the second-order NLO response. This ordered self-organization within the intercalated organic layers contributes significantly to the very large SHG observed in the materials.",

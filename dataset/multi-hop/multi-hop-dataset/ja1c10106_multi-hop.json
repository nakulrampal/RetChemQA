      "answer": "The formation of [Cu4Pb18]4– over [Cu4Pb22]4– is controlled by the Cu/Pb ratio in solution and the inherent stability of the icosahedron, which drives the coalescence of two endohedral MPbx fragments to form a single Pb18 cage.",

      "question": "What is the role of the mesityl ligands in the formation of larger clusters containing Au?",
      "answer": "The mesityl ligands may be lost via C-C coupling reactions, forming bimesityl, which facilitates the reduction of Au+ to Au and the nucleation of additional zerovalent metal atoms on the cluster surface.",

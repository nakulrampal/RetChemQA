      "question": "What are the synthesis conditions for the cyclo-pentazolate salts containing NH4+?",
      "answer": "A mixture of [Mg(H2O)6]2+[(N5)2(H2O)4]2ˉ (1.00 mmol) in methanol and the sulfate salt (1.00 mmol) in an aqueous solution was stirred and held at a temperature range from −10 to 25 °C for 6 hours. The solvent of the clear solution was removed in vacuo, and the residue was washed twice with Et2O and finally repeatedly recrystallized from anhydrous ethanol.",

    {
      "question": "What method was used to collect the diffraction data for the cyclo-pentazolate salts?",
      "answer": "The diffraction data were collected on a Bruker P4 diffractometer with SAINT and APEX 2 suite at 153K.",

    {
      "question": "How were the hydrogen atoms located in the crystal structure determination of cyclo-pentazolate salts?",
      "answer": "The hydrogen atoms were located from difference Fourier map inspection and freely refined with Uiso(H) = 1.5Ueq (N, O).",

      "question": "What safety precautions are recommended when handling the investigated compounds due to their potentially explosive nature?",
      "answer": "Small scale and appropriate safety precautions such as safety glasses, face shields, heavy leather gloves and jackets, and ear plugs are strongly encouraged.",

      "question": "What was the method used for the synthesis of [N(CH3)4]+N5ˉ and how was the product obtained?",
      "answer": "A solution of tetramethylammonium iodide in methanol was added dropwise to a stirred suspension solution of AgN5 in an aqueous methanol. After stirring at room temperature for 1.5 hours under exclusion of light, the silver iodide was removed, and the filtrate was dried in air to give a white product.",

      "question": "What was the role of metathesis in the synthesis of M+N5ˉ salts and what were the conditions for the reaction?",
      "answer": "Metathesis was used to accomplish the exchange of ions in ionic compounds. It required the starting materials, A+B− and C+D−, to be soluble and one of the desired products, AD or CB, to be insoluble to permit easy product separation.",

    {
      "question": "What was the observed effect of amine and phosphine ligands on the decomposition of AgN5?",
      "answer": "When the amines and phosphine were added dropwise to an AgN5 suspension in ethanol, the solid dissolved with N2 evolution. The rate of N2 evolution decreased in the order CH3NH2 > C3H4N2 ≥ PPh3 ≥ C5H5N.",

    {
      "question": "What was the significance of the thermal stability measurements for the cyclo-pentazolate compounds?",
      "answer": "The thermal stability measurements indicated that the cyclo-pentazolate compounds exhibit good thermal stability with onset decomposition temperatures of more than 85 °C, except for [N(CH3)4]+N5ˉ with an onset decomposition temperature of 80.8 °C, suggesting that the cation-π interaction in [N(CH3)4]+N5ˉ is weaker than the hydrogen bonding in the other pentazolate compounds.",

    },
    {
      "question": "Based on the synthesis and characterization of cyclo-pentazolate salts, what are the potential applications of these compounds?",
      "answer": "The cyclo-pentazolate salts are energetic materials, outperforming the corresponding azides, and in the case of the hydrazinium and hydroxylammonium salts match the detonation pressure of RDX, but significantly exceed RDX and HMX in terms of detonation velocity due to their high energetic-nitrogen content. This suggests potential applications as explosives and rocket propellants.",

      "question": "What is the significance of the reversible single crystal-to-single crystal double [2+2] photocyclisation in the coordination framework based on an electroactive tetrathiafulvalene?",
      "answer": "The reversible single crystal-to-single crystal double [2+2] photocyclisation in the coordination framework based on an electroactive tetrathiafulvalene leads to profound differences in the electrochemical, electronic, optical, and mechanical properties of the material upon light irradiation. This reversible structural transformation opens up new potential applications for coordination frameworks in photo-mechanical and photoelectrochemical devices, such as light-driven actuators and photo-valves for targeted drug delivery.",

      "question": "What challenges were encountered in using 1H-NMR spectroscopy to evidence the structural transformation of the coordination framework?",
      "answer": "Challenges encountered in using 1H-NMR spectroscopy to evidence the structural transformation included the inability to digest the framework 3 for NMR analysis, suggesting significant decomposition of 3 upon disruption of the framework. This limitation, along with the desire for in situ monitoring of the transition, led to the use of X-ray crystallography, PXRD, and Raman analysis instead.",

      "question": "What novel aspect does the study introduce in the field of coordination frameworks?",
      "answer": "The study introduces the novel aspect of using double [2+2] photocyclisation in a metal-organic framework (MOF) to realize a range of new properties that can be controlled, specifically exploring a redox-active ligand. This enables a reversible structural transition that controls the electrochemical profile of the material, offering a new paradigm for photo- and thermally sensitive switchable redox-active MOFs.",

      "question": "How does the reversible [2+2] photocyclisation affect the electrochemical properties of the coordination framework?",
      "answer": "The reversible [2+2] photocyclisation affects the electrochemical properties of the coordination framework by enabling a switchable capability. The transition from the original framework to the cyclised form leads to changes in the electrochemical profile, including the appearance or disappearance of redox peaks in cyclic voltammetry, demonstrating the material's ability to switch its redox activity based on the structural state.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the reversible [2+2] photocyclisation process in the coordination framework quantitatively reversible, and how was this determined?",
      "answer": "The reversible [2+2] photocyclisation process in the coordination framework is quantitatively reversible, as determined by deconvoluting specific peaks in the Raman spectra collected during photo-irradiated and isothermal Raman experiments. This analysis provided a semi-quantitative assessment of the percentage conversion for both the forward and backward reactions, indicating complete conversion in the backward reaction.",

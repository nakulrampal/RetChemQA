      "question": "What is the role of H2O in the transformation from FZU to NJU-Bai34 according to the synthesis conditions?",
      "answer": "H2O molecules act as Î¼3-O playing the role of linking three adjacent Cu atoms and locking them in the tetranuclear inorganic cluster.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the addition of CH3COOH affect the transformation from FZU to NJU-Bai34?",
      "answer": "CH3COOH serves as terminal coordinated molecules to eliminate extra coordination number increased by new-incorporated Cu atoms, which is essential in keeping the new synthesized structure isoreticular to the original one.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the transformation from MOF-5-iv to MOF-5 in the context of symmetry-upgradingly isoreticular transformation?",
      "answer": "The transformation from MOF-5-iv to MOF-5 demonstrates the applicability of the symmetry-upgradingly isoreticular transformation method, proving that it is not unique to the initially discussed MOFs and can be applied to other MOF materials as well.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the transformation from FZU to NJU-Bai34 reversible?",
      "answer": "False. The transformation from FZU to NJU-Bai34 is not reversible; it is a single-pass from low symmetry to high symmetry.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What experimental technique was used to monitor the transformation process from FZU to NJU-Bai34 and NJU-Bai35?",
      "answer": "Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) was used to monitor the transformation process from FZU to NJU-Bai34 and NJU-Bai35.",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of Cl- ions in the transformation from FZU to NJU-Bai35?",
      "answer": "Cl- ions serve as terminal coordinated molecules to eliminate the increase of coordination number caused by new-incorporated Cu atoms, which is essential in keeping the new synthesized structure isoreticular to the original one.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the addition of CH3CN influence the transformation from FZU to NJU-Bai34?",
      "answer": "The addition of CH3CN helps CH3COOH win the competition of coordination with Cu atoms, facilitating the complete transformation from FZU to NJU-Bai34.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What method was used to calculate the CO2 adsorption enthalpies for FZU, NJU-Bai34, and NJU-Bai35?",
      "answer": "A virial-type expression comprising temperature-independent parameters was employed to calculate the CO2 adsorption enthalpies for FZU, NJU-Bai34, and NJU-Bai35.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What does the transformation from MOF-5-iv to MOF-5 indicate about the symmetry of inorganic clusters in MOFs?",
      "answer": "The transformation from MOF-5-iv to MOF-5 indicates that inorganic clusters with higher symmetry exhibit lower energy than those with lower symmetry, and this principle can be applied to achieve symmetry-upgradingly isoreticular transformations in MOFs.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the transformation process from FZU to NJU-Bai34 dependent solely on the concentration of Cu2+ ions?",
      "answer": "False. The transformation process from FZU to NJU-Bai34 is not solely dependent on the concentration of Cu2+ ions but also requires the cooperative effect of H2O, CH3COOH, and the concentration of Cu2+ ions.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"

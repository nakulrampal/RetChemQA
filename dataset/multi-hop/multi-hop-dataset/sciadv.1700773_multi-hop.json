    {
      "question": "What is the main challenge in synthesizing materials with structures composed of multiple metal cations?",
      "answer": "The main challenge is simultaneously addressing the incorporation of different elements at desired precise positions due to the difficulty of controlling the disposition of the metal elements.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the selected metal-organic framework (MOF) allow for the incorporation of multiple metal elements?",
      "answer": "The selected MOF, built with a rod-shaped inorganic secondary building unit (SBU), allows for the incorporation of multiple metal elements at specific positions in a controllable manner at atomic and mesoscopic scales.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does the 'molar code' play in the synthesis of MOFs with multiple metal cations?",
      "answer": "The 'molar code', defined by the initial molar ratio of the used metal elements, drives the incorporation and arrangement of the MOF metal components at the atomic and nanoscales, and at the mesoscopic scale.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the phase transformation observed in the MOF prepared from a Zn:Co 1:10 molar code?",
      "answer": "The phase transformation, resulting in a unit cell with a doubled c parameter and the presence of both octahedral and tetrahedral metal sites, indicates the adaptability of the SBU to include octahedrally coordinated cations while maintaining the overall MOF topology.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the incorporation of manganese in the molar code affect the compositional arrangement of the resulting MOF?",
      "answer": "The incorporation of manganese, which has a clear propensity for an octahedral coordination environment, allows for the homogeneous distribution of cobalt and results in MOFs with homogeneous compositional arrangements without gradients.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the impact of the compositional and structural complexities on the physical properties of MOFs?",
      "answer": "The compositional and structural complexities, determined by the geometry of the SBUs, the atomic distribution of cations, and the possible mesoscopic interaction among SBUs, define the physical properties of MOFs, such as their magnetic properties.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The MOF prepared from a Zn:Co 1:2 molar code exhibits ferromagnetism within the SBUs below 15 K.",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The presence of zinc in the structure has a stabilizing effect on the octahedral site.",
      "answer": "False",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The MOF prepared from a Zn:Co 1:10 molar code undergoes a phase transformation at room temperature.",
      "answer": "False",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The MOF prepared from a Zn:Mn:Co 1:1:1 molar code shows a compositional gradient of zinc and cobalt.",
      "answer": "False",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"

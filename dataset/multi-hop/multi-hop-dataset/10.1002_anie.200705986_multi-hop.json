      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why can MeOH molecules enter the small aperture of the channel in the partially dehydrated phase 1 a, but MeCN cannot?",
      "answer": "MeOH molecules can enter the small aperture due to their ability to form strong H-bonds with the hydrophilic pore surface, whereas MeCN cannot form such bonds, preventing it from entering the pore.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What causes the initial slow rise of the absorption profile in the low-pressure region for guest molecules?",
      "answer": "The initial slow rise of the absorption profile is caused by the strong affinity of guest molecules toward the hydrophilic pore surface within the very small channel aperture, making it difficult for them to easily enter.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the structural transformation affect the cross-sectional shape of the one-dimensional channels?",
      "answer": "The structural transformation changes the cross-sectional shape of the one-dimensional channels from pseudosquare in 1 to parallelogram in 1 a, mainly due to the movement of the flexible arms of the ligand.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role do the carbonyl groups of the ligand play in the selective sorption behavior of the synthesized frameworks?",
      "answer": "The carbonyl groups of the ligand, being part of the FOSs, are directed towards the channel pore and are free to form strong H-bonds, contributing to the selective sorption behavior by interacting with guest molecules.",

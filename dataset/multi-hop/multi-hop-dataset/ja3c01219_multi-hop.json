      "question": "What is the main objective of the dynamic bond-directed synthesis method described in the text?",
      "answer": "The main objective is to synthesize stable mesoporous metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) under room temperature conditions that allow for the in situ encapsulation of labile functional species such as polyoxometalates (POMs), CdSeS/ZnS quantum dots, and coordination cages.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the dynamic bond-directed synthesis method improve the stability of MOFs?",
      "answer": "By kinetic control at room temperature and avoiding harsh conditions, the method enables the synthesis of MOFs with low connected Zr6 clusters and large mesopores, which are difficult to isolate in traditional solvothermal reactions, thus improving the MOFs' stability.",

      "question": "What are the key components used in the synthesis of compound 1 and compound 1'?",
      "answer": "The key components for compound 1 include ZrCl4, INA, Cu(NO3)2∙2.5H2O, and DMF. For compound 1', H2L1 is used for linker exchange with compound 1.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of using room temperature conditions in the synthesis of MOFs according to the dynamic bond-directed method?",
      "answer": "Room temperature conditions are significant because they allow for the synthesis of stable mesoporous MOFs without the need for harsh conditions, which can degrade sensitive functional species. This enables the in situ encapsulation of labile species within the MOFs.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"

    },
    {
      "question": "What role does H2L1 play in the transformation of compound 1 to compound 1'?",
      "answer": "H2L1 acts as a stable linear linker that is used to replace the labile Cu-pyridyl-based linker in compound 1 through a postsynthetic modification process, transforming it into compound 1'.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does the dynamic bond-directed synthesis method contribute to the discovery of new MOFs?",
      "answer": "The method contributes by enabling the synthesis of MOFs with unique structures and topologies, such as low connected Zr6 clusters and large mesopores, which are difficult to achieve through traditional methods, thus accelerating the discovery of novel MOFs.",

      "question": "What advantages does the in situ encapsulation of functional species in MOFs offer according to the dynamic bond-directed synthesis method?",
      "answer": "The in situ encapsulation offers advantages such as protecting labile species from degradation during MOF synthesis, enabling the direct incorporation of functional species into MOFs, and enhancing the MOFs' functionality for applications like catalysis and sensing.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"

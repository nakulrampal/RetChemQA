      "question": "What is the significance of the fluorine presence in the clusters of Ho-MOFs?",
      "answer": "The presence of fluorine in the clusters instead of the commonly assumed hydroxy groups has major implications in the synthesis of RE MOFs using 2-fba. It suggests that most, if not all, MOFs using fluorinated modulators to incorporate RE clusters contain μ3-F bridges in their structures. This discovery necessitates a closer reexamination of these structures, as the presence of fluorine could influence the properties and applications of these MOFs.",

      "question": "How does the use of 2-fba as a modulator affect the formation of fluoro-bridged clusters in RE MOFs?",
      "answer": "The use of 2-fba as a modulator is crucial for the formation of fluoro-bridged clusters in RE MOFs. It facilitates the extraction of fluorine from the modulator, leading to the formation of μ3-F bridges within the clusters. This process is likely mediated by mechanisms such as single electron transfer (SET) or fluorine transfer and benzyne formation, which are suggested for the synthesis of RE MOFs.",

      "question": "What analytical techniques were used to confirm the presence of fluorine in the clusters of Ho-MOFs?",
      "answer": "Several analytical techniques were employed to confirm the presence of fluorine in the clusters of Ho-MOFs, including X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). These techniques provided evidence of fluorine and helped characterize the structure and composition of the MOFs.",

      "question": "What role does the fluorinated modulator play in the synthesis of RE MOFs, and how does it contribute to the formation of fluoro-bridged clusters?",
      "answer": "The fluorinated modulator, such as 2-fba, plays a critical role in the synthesis of RE MOFs by providing fluorine atoms that are incorporated into the structure as μ3-F bridges. This incorporation is facilitated through mechanisms like C-F activation and fluorine extraction mediated by REs, which lead to the formation of fluoro-bridged clusters. The presence of fluorine from the modulator significantly influences the structure and potentially the properties of the resulting MOFs.",

    {
      "question": "What evidence supports the hypothesis that previously reported RE MOFs using fluorinated modulators contain μ3-F bridges?",
      "answer": "Evidence supporting the hypothesis includes the analysis of crystallographic information files (CIFs) from other RE cluster-containing MOFs that used 2-fba or 2,6-dfba in their synthesis. The analysis revealed features consistent with the presence of μ3-F bridges, such as unusually smaller thermal/displacement ellipsoids for the bridging groups compared to the rare-earth metal centers. Additionally, complementary analytical techniques like XPS confirmed the presence of both holmium and fluorine in the MOFs, further supporting the presence of μ3-F bridges.",

      "question": "How does the presence of fluorine in RE MOFs influence their properties and potential applications?",
      "answer": "The presence of fluorine in RE MOFs, particularly in the form of μ3-F bridges, could influence their properties such as photoluminescence, water stability, hydrophobicity, and CO2 selectivities. For example, a terbium hexacluster containing μ3-F bridges showed higher photoluminescence compared to its μ3-OH-bridged analogue. This suggests that the presence of fluorine could enhance certain properties, making these MOFs suitable for applications in gas separation, sensing, and catalysis.",

These challenges can be addressed by optimizing the synthesis conditions, such as the choice of modulators, reaction temperature, and time. Additionally, thorough characterization of the MOFs using techniques like XPS, FT-IR, and NMR can help in understanding the structure-property relationships and guide the design of MOFs with specific functionalities.",

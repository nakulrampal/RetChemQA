      "question": "Which MOF, MIL-53 or MIL-47, shows a pronounced preference for ortho-isomers in all experiments?",

      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the selectivity between xylene isomers change with concentration in MIL-53?",
      "answer": "The selectivity increases with bulk concentration or degree of pore filling.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the effect of the adsorbate concentration on the adsorption preference of MIL-53 for p-xylene compared to m-xylene?",
      "answer": "At high concentrations, MIL-53's adsorption preference shifts towards p-xylene over m-xylene.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What determines the order of selectivity among xylene isomers in MIL-53 at low concentrations?",
      "answer": "The strength of interaction between the methyl groups of the adsorbates and the carboxylate groups of the MIL-53 framework.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does MIL-53 have a different selectivity pattern compared to MIL-47 for adsorption of alkylaromatics?",
      "answer": "The presence of different metals in MIL-53 and MIL-47 leads to different polarization of the carboxylate groups, affecting the strength of interaction with the adsorbates.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the relationship between the degree of pore filling and selectivity in MIL-53 for C8 alkylaromatics?",
      "answer": "The selectivity increases with the degree of pore filling due to differences in molecular packing efficiency among the isomers.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the presence of two methyl groups in o-xylene influence its interaction with MIL-53?",
      "answer": "Both methyl groups in o-xylene can interact with the carboxylate groups of the MIL-53 framework, leading to stronger adsorption.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does p-xylene show increased affinity for MIL-53 at higher intraporous concentrations?",
      "answer": "At higher intraporous concentrations, favorable adsorbateâˆ’adsorbate interactions become possible for p-xylene, lowering the energy cost to fill the pores.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does the flexibility of MIL-53's pores play in its adsorption properties?",
      "answer": "The flexibility of MIL-53's pores allows for specific interactions and different packing modes of the adsorbates, affecting selectivity.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the selectivity for ortho-isomers by MIL-53 consistent across different alkylaromatic compounds?",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "Does MIL-53 show a higher selectivity for p-xylene over o-xylene at low concentrations?",
      "answer": "False",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "Are the adsorption preferences of MIL-53 and MIL-47 for alkylaromatics identical?",
      "answer": "False",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "Does the selectivity among xylene isomers in MIL-53 decrease with increasing bulk concentration?",

      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can MIL-53 be used to selectively retain ortho-compounds from a feed of alkylaromatic isomers?",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the interaction between methyl groups of adsorbates and carboxylate groups of the MIL-53 framework unique to MIL-53 compared to MIL-47?",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"

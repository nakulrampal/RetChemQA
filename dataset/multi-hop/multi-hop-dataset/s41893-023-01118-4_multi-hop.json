      "question": "What is the primary goal of the study conducted by Shengbo Zhang and colleagues, as published in Nature Sustainability?",
      "answer": "The primary goal of the study is to present a practical and viable solution for the sustainable management of plastic waste by demonstrating a binuclear complex that can catalyze the degradation of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and a wide spectrum of other plastics under mild conditions.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What inspired the design of the binuclear catalyst used for plastic degradation in the study?",
      "answer": "The design of the binuclear catalyst was inspired by hydrolases, a group of enzymes that catalyze bond cleavages with water, featuring biomimetic Zn-Zn sites that activate the plastic, stabilize the key intermediate, and enable intramolecular hydrolysis.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the specific activity of the binuclear zinc catalyst towards PET depolymerization change with pH and temperature?",
      "answer": "The specific activity of the binuclear zinc catalyst towards PET depolymerization increases significantly with the increases in temperature and pH, demonstrating robustness over a wide range of operational conditions.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The study demonstrates a closed-loop production of bottle-grade PET using the recycled terephthalate.",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does water play in the catalytic process of PET depolymerization by the binuclear zinc catalyst?",
      "answer": "Water plays essential roles in the catalytic process by stabilizing the under-coordinated Zn atom, strengthening Zn-O(EGD) binding, and enabling the dissociation of EGD to BzO and EGM.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the μ2-O bridged Zn-Zn with a distance of 3.2 Å in the structure of the binuclear zinc catalyst?",
      "answer": "The μ2-O bridged Zn-Zn with a distance of 3.2 Å is significant because it closely resembles the binuclear metal centers in metallohydrolases, which are critical for accelerating hydrolytic processes via the proximity effect.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The binuclear zinc catalyst remains stable and retains its structure after being loaded on carbon support for convenient catalyst separation and recycling.",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the crystallinity of PET feedstock impact the hydrolysis kinetics of Zn2/C?",
      "answer": "The crystallinity of PET feedstock has limited impact on the hydrolysis kinetics of Zn2/C, indicating that Zn2/C can effectively depolymerize both amorphous and crystalline PET granules under the tested conditions.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The study's techno-economic assessment indicates that the PET recycling process using Zn2/C could generate a net profit on 0.1 megatons of PET waste per year.",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of the proximity effect in the catalytic efficiency of the binuclear zinc catalyst for PET depolymerization?",
      "answer": "The proximity effect in the catalytic efficiency of the binuclear zinc catalyst for PET depolymerization involves bringing the reactants in close proximity, leading to increased local concentration of nucleophilic hydroxide and enabling intramolecular reaction pathways.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"

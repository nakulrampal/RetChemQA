      "question": "What is the purpose of using molecular rotor dynamics in the synthesis of porous coordination polymers?",
      "answer": "The purpose of using molecular rotor dynamics in the synthesis of porous coordination polymers is to store gas molecules such as CO2 and CH4 in the pores via steric hindrance control.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does the temperature affect the adsorption of CO2 in CID-Me?",
      "answer": "At 195 K, there is no adsorption behavior due to inadequate size of the pore window for CO2. However, at 296 K, a gradual CO2 uptake is observed, indicating physisorption.",
      "difficulty": "Medium",
      "type": "Factual"
    },

    },
    {
      "question": "What role do the rotational dynamics of PY2 and the wobbling of methylbenzene ring play in the adsorption process?",
      "answer": "The rotational dynamics of PY2 and the wobbling of the methylbenzene ring dynamically expand the pore windows, allowing for the diffusion of CO2 into the porosities at room temperature.",
      "difficulty": "Hard",
      "type": "Factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the 13C MAS-NMR and CP-MAS-NMR analyses in the study?",
      "answer": "The 13C MAS-NMR and CP-MAS-NMR analyses reveal the local structure and mobility of CO2 and the rotors, indicating that the slow rotation of the rotors provides steric hindrance for adsorbed CO2, leading to an unusually slow mobility.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What is the effect of vacuum at 195 K on the adsorbed CO2 in CID-Me?",
      "answer": "Under vacuum at 195 K, the static mode of PY2 and 5-Me-ip acts as steric hindrance for CO2, preventing desorption and diffusion of CO2, thus maintaining CO2 in the cavities.",
      "difficulty": "Medium",
      "type": "Factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the relationship between the rotational frequency of PY2 and the mobility of adsorbed CO2?",
      "answer": "The rotational frequency of PY2 is much slower than the mobility of adsorbed CO2, indicating that the mobility of CO2 in the cavities is restricted by the steric hindrance of PY2 and 5-Me-ip.",
      "difficulty": "Medium",
      "type": "Reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the size of the pore window at 195 K compare to the size of CO2 molecules?",
      "answer": "The size of the pore window at 195 K is smaller than that of CO2 molecules, indicating that CO2 cannot enter into the porosities at this temperature.",
      "difficulty": "Medium",
      "type": "Reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens to the CO2 adsorption behavior at 195 K and 296 K?",
      "answer": "At 195 K, there is no CO2 adsorption behavior, while at 296 K, there is a gradual CO2 uptake indicating physisorption.",
      "difficulty": "Medium",
      "type": "Reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the structure of CID-Me change under CO2 at room temperature?",
      "answer": "The XRD pattern of CID-Me under CO2 at room temperature does not change, suggesting that the crystal structure remains the same up until 1 atm of CO2.",
      "difficulty": "Medium",
      "type": "Reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of the continuous rotations or vibration of the rotors in the adsorption process?",
      "answer": "The continuous rotations or vibration of the rotors strongly affect the size of the pore window, allowing for the diffusion of CO2 into the porosities at room temperature.",
      "difficulty": "Medium",
      "type": "Reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the mechanism of CO2 storage in CID-Me differ from that in MOF-5?",
      "answer": "In CID-Me, CO2 storage is controlled by the rotation or vibration of molecular rotors, while in MOF-5, the phenylene ring rotors show static modes and do not affect the diffusion of CO2.",
      "difficulty": "Hard",
      "type": "Reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the storage mechanism demonstrated in the study applicable to gases other than CO2?",

          "question": "What are the synthesis conditions for Pb(Clterpy)[Au(CN)2]2?",
          "answer": "To synthesize Pb(Clterpy)[Au(CN)2]2, Clterpy was dissolved in methanol, to which a methanol solution containing Pb(ClO4)2·xH2O was added. The solution was heated until all Clterpy dissolved, cooled to room temperature, and then a methanol solution of [nBu4N][Au(CN)2]·1/2H2O was added dropwise. The solution was allowed to evaporate for several days to form yellow crystals.",

          "question": "What method was used to measure the birefringence values of the coordination polymers?",
          "answer": "Birefringence values were measured using polarized-light microscopy with a tilting thick Berek compensator at λ = 546.1 nm at room temperature.",

          "answer": "The birefringence of Mn(Brterpy)[Au(CN)2]2 is 0.50(3), which is larger than the birefringence of Mn(terpy)[Au(CN)2]2, indicating that the substitution of terpy with Brterpy increased the birefringence.",

          "question": "What role does the polarizability anisotropy of the C−X bond play in the birefringence of the coordination polymers?",
          "answer": "The polarizability anisotropy of the C−X bond contributes to the birefringence by increasing the polarizability along the direction of maximum birefringence, especially when the bond is well-aligned in the measurement plane.",

          "question": "How does the crystal growth direction affect the measured birefringence of monoclinic crystals?",
          "answer": "The measured birefringence of monoclinic crystals depends on the crystal growth direction, as it may represent the difference between two principal components of the indicatrix or a slice of the indicatrix, affecting the observed birefringence value.",

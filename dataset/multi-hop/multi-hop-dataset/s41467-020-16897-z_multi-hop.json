      "question": "How does Co2(OH)2(bbta) achieve high O2 uptake capacity at low pressures?",
      "answer": "Co2(OH)2(bbta) achieves high O2 uptake capacity at low pressures through strong and reversible adsorption of O2, facilitated by both electron transfer and hydrogen bonding interactions.",

      "question": "What is the significance of the observed negative cooperativity in O2 binding in Co2(OH)2(bbta)?",
      "answer": "The observed negative cooperativity in O2 binding in Co2(OH)2(bbta) is significant because it is unprecedented in an extended framework material and indicates that the interaction of O2 with the framework changes drastically as a function of O2 pressure, resulting in incomplete occupation of the open metal sites even at high pressures.",

      "question": "How does the basicity of hydroxo ligands in Co2(OH)2(bbta) contribute to its O2 adsorption properties?",
      "answer": "The basicity of hydroxo ligands in Co2(OH)2(bbta) contributes to its O2 adsorption properties by increasing the reducing potential of the cobalt(II) sites and engaging in secondary-sphere hydrogen bonding interactions with bound superoxo groups, providing stabilization to the adsorbed O2.",

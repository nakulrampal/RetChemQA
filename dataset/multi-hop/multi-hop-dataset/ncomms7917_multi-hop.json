      "question": "What is the significance of the guest molecules in altering the thermal expansion behavior of the ultramicroporous crystal?",
      "answer": "The guest molecules, specifically the supramolecular dimers, play a crucial role in altering the thermal expansion behavior of the ultramicroporous crystal by utilizing not only molecular static effects but also bulk dynamic properties to control the host dynamics. Their anisotropic thermal expansion can significantly change the flexibility mode and thermal expansion behavior of the crystal, including the magnitude and even the anisotropy of thermal expansion coefficients.",

    {
      "question": "How does the presence of guest molecules like DMF and DMA affect the thermal expansion coefficients of the ultramicroporous crystal?",
      "answer": "The presence of guest molecules like DMF and DMA affects the thermal expansion coefficients of the ultramicroporous crystal by providing significant guest-modulation effects. These effects can drastically change both the magnitude and anisotropy of thermal expansion. For example, the presence of DMF and DMA can lead to changes in the principal axial thermal expansion coefficients, demonstrating the ability of guest molecules to modulate the thermal expansion behavior of the host framework.",

      "question": "What role does the framework flexibility of the ultramicroporous crystal play in its thermal expansion behavior?",
      "answer": "The framework flexibility of the ultramicroporous crystal plays a pivotal role in its thermal expansion behavior by allowing the host structures to be altered by external stimuli, such as temperature changes and the presence of guest molecules. This flexibility, particularly the three-dimensional hinge-like structure and quasi-0D ultramicropores, enables the crystal to exhibit drastic guest-modulation effects on thermal expansion, including changes in magnitude and anisotropy.",

      "question": "What experimental techniques were used to study the structural transformations of the ultramicroporous crystal under temperature and guest stimuli?",
      "answer": "The structural transformations of the ultramicroporous crystal under temperature and guest stimuli were studied using variable-temperature powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) analyses. These techniques allowed for the direct visualization and understanding of the dynamic behaviors of both the host framework and the guest molecules.",

      "question": "How does the synthesis condition, specifically the solvothermal reaction, contribute to the formation of the ultramicroporous crystal?",
      "answer": "The solvothermal reaction, conducted at 90Â°C using a mixture of Cd(NO3)2, 3-(pyridin-4-yl)benzoic acid (H34pba), and 4-(pyridin-4-yl)benzoic acid (H44pba) in mixed solvent ethanol/water, contributes to the formation of the ultramicroporous crystal by facilitating the crystallization process. This method allows for the controlled growth of colorless needle-shaped crystals with a specific three-dimensional hinge-like structure and quasi-0D ultramicropores, which are essential for its unique thermal expansion behavior.",

      "question": "True or False: The ultramicroporous crystal cannot adsorb N2 and Ar gases due to their kinetic diameters being larger than the pore size.",

    {
      "question": "What is the impact of the quasi-0D ultramicropores on the adsorption behavior of the ultramicroporous crystal?",
      "answer": "The quasi-0D ultramicropores impact the adsorption behavior of the ultramicroporous crystal by allowing the formation of low-dimensional guest aggregations with abnormal/appealing properties. These ultramicropores, due to their size and shape, can selectively adsorb smaller molecules like O2 while exhibiting slow adsorption/desorption kinetics for gases, indicating a high-energy barrier for gas diffusion within the pores.",

      "question": "True or False: The ultramicroporous crystal's thermal expansion behavior is independent of the guest molecules present within its structure.",

      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "How do the guest molecules DMF and DMA differ in their impact on the thermal expansion of the ultramicroporous crystal?",
      "answer": "DMF and DMA differ in their impact on the thermal expansion of the ultramicroporous crystal primarily due to their size and the orientation of their supramolecular dimers within the pores. DMF, being smaller, exhibits a larger overlap and a more significant increase in the interplanar separation within a dimer upon heating, leading to a more pronounced thermal expansion effect compared to DMA. This difference in behavior between DMF and DMA dimers highlights the role of guest molecule size and orientation in modulating the thermal expansion properties of the host framework.",

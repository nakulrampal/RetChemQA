      "question": "What materials were synthesized in the study and what was their main application?",
      "answer": "Selective Cu and Ni-MOFs were synthesized as pre-catalysts for the hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol.",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What method was used for the synthesis of MOF 1 and MOF 2, and what were their key structural features?",
      "answer": "MOF 1 and MOF 2 were synthesized by solvothermal synthesis. MOF 1 featured a distorted octahedral geometry with Cu(II) centers, while MOF 2 had a Ni(II) center with an octahedral geometry.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How was the stability of MOF 1 and MOF 2 tested, and what were the findings?",
      "answer": "The stability of MOF 1 and MOF 2 was tested by immersing them in different organic solvents and analyzing them using FT-IR and PXRD. Both MOFs showed high stability in polar solvents, with MOF 2 slightly unstable in water.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What was the main finding of the catalytic hydrogenation of furfural using MOF 2?",
      "answer": "MOF 2 showed promising performance in the hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol, achieving 81% conversion of furfural and 100% selectivity towards furfuryl alcohol.",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What were the optimal conditions determined for the hydrogenation reaction using MOF 2?",
      "answer": "The optimal conditions for the hydrogenation reaction using MOF 2 were 45 bar of H2 pressure, 140 Â°C, and a reaction time of 24 hours in methanol.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How was the reusability of MOF 2 tested, and what were the results?",
      "answer": "The reusability of MOF 2 was tested through recycling experiments for four cycles. MOF 2 could be reused with negligible loss in catalytic activity and minimal metal leaching.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: MOF 1 showed better performance than MOF 2 in the catalytic hydrogenation of furfural.",
      "answer": "False. MOF 2 showed better performance in the catalytic hydrogenation of furfural, with MOF 1 dissolving during catalysis.",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The structural integrity of MOF 2 was altered significantly after catalysis and recycling.",
      "answer": "False. The structural integrity of MOF 2 was retained after catalysis and recycling, as confirmed by PXRD, SEM-EDX, and XPS analyses.",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What was the proposed mechanism for the hydrogenation of furfural using MOF 2?",
      "answer": "The proposed mechanism involved the coordination of molecular hydrogen with the Ni(II) metal center in MOF 2, forming a dihydride species that facilitates the hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The study found that MOF 2 was highly selective towards the formation of furfuryl alcohol with no side products detected.",
      "answer": "True. MOF 2 was highly selective towards the formation of furfuryl alcohol, with 100% selectivity and no side products detected.",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"

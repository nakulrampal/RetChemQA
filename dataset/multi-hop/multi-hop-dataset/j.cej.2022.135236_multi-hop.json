    {
      "question": "What is the lattice mismatch percentage between In-dpda and ZIF-8 frameworks?",
      "answer": "Less than 2.2%",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What method was used to synthesize the ZIF-8-on-In-dpda heterostructure?",
      "answer": "A liquid phase epitaxial method was adopted to synthesize ZIF-8-on-In-dpda heterostructure.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How was the limit of detection (LOD) for histamine sensing by F-10c⊂ZIF-8-on-In-dpda calculated?",
      "answer": "The LOD was evaluated based on the equation 3σ/S, where σ represents the standard deviation of 5 times replicated measurements of probe solution and S is the slope of the calibration curve.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What was the role of the blank ZIF-8 layers in the synthesis of F-RB⊂ZIF-8-on-In-dpda?",
      "answer": "The blank ZIF-8 layers were introduced to spatially separate F and subsequent RB, preventing direct interaction between two dyes and allowing precise adjustment for encapsulation contents.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the ZIF-8-on-In-dpda heterostructure stable under strong acid and basic conditions?",
      "answer": "Yes, the PXRD results showed that In-dpda was stable even under strong acid and basic conditions.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What was the main purpose of using a dual-emission platform in the detection of histamine?",
      "answer": "The dual-emission platform was used to achieve ratiometric detection of histamine, allowing for both quantitative detection and visual monitoring of histamine levels.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can the fluorescent color of guests⊂ZIF-8-on-In-dpda be readjusted after initial synthesis?",
      "answer": "Yes, the fluorescent platform allows readjustment via subsequent dyes encapsulation, improving the fault tolerance rate of fluorescent adjustment.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What was the calculated limit of detection (LOD) for histamine using F-10c⊂ZIF-8-on-In-dpda?",
      "answer": "The calculated LOD for histamine using F-10c⊂ZIF-8-on-In-dpda was 4.7 nM.",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What mechanism was proposed for the detection of histamine by F-10c⊂ZIF-8-on-In-dpda?",
      "answer": "The detection mechanism was proposed to be a photoinduced electron transfer (PET) process, specifically an a-PET process where electrons transfer from the donor to the fluorophore.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Was the structural integrity of F-10c⊂ZIF-8-on-In-dpda maintained after histamine detection?",
      "answer": "Yes, a stable PXRD pattern of F-10c⊂ZIF-8-on-In-dpda confirmed that the heterostructure retained integrity after the histamine detection.",

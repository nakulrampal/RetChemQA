      "question": "What is the main goal of refining the pore size in MFM-300(M) materials?",
      "answer": "The main goal of refining the pore size in MFM-300(M) materials is to achieve precise discrimination and excellent chromatographic separation of three xylene isomers with exceptional separation factors at room temperature.",

    {
      "question": "What method is currently used in industry for the separation of xylene isomers, and what are its drawbacks?",
      "answer": "The separation of xylene isomers in industry is currently performed via either fractional crystallisation operating at ~220 K or adsorption in porous adsorbents, such as cation-exchanged FAU-type zeolites X and Y. The drawbacks include limited recovery of p-xylene due to the eutectic point and high energy consumption for cooling in fractional crystallisation, and the requirement of high temperature and pressure in adsorption-based processes.",

    {
      "question": "How does the pore size of MFM-300(M) materials vary and what is its significance for xylene separation?",
      "answer": "The pore size of MFM-300(M) materials varies between 6.5 and 7.4 Å, decreasing periodically by 0.2 Å at the hydroxyl bridges, affording a helical zigzag 1D channel. This narrow pore size region is significant for xylene separation as it is relevant to the molecular cross-section sizes of p-, o-, and m-xylene, potentially identifying the 'sweet spot' for their separation.",

    {
      "question": "What is the elution order of xylene isomers in MFM-300 materials and how does it compare to other MOFs?",
      "answer": "The elution order of xylene isomers in MFM-300 materials is p-, o-, and then m-xylene. This order is distinct from all previously reported MOFs, where varying elution orders were observed in different systems.",

    {
      "question": "What techniques were used to investigate the binding domains for adsorbed xylene molecules within MFM-300?",
      "answer": "High-resolution synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction experiments, terahertz spectroscopy, and molecular dynamic (MD) modelling were used to investigate the binding domains for adsorbed xylene molecules within MFM-300.",

    {
      "question": "What are the key factors that dictate the low-energy separation of xylene isomers in MFM-300 materials?",
      "answer": "The key factors that dictate the low-energy separation of xylene isomers in MFM-300 materials are a complex balance of pore size, shape, and chemistry, coupled with cooperative supramolecular interactions within the pore interiors and kinetic molecular sieving effects.",

      "question": "True or False: The separation of xylene isomers in MFM-300 materials is influenced only by the kinetic molecular sieving mechanism.",

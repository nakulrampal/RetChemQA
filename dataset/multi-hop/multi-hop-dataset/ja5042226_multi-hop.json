      "question": "What is the role of semirigid double-hinged di-1,2,4-triazoles in the synthesis of metalâ€“organic nanotubes (MONTs)?",
      "answer": "Semirigid double-hinged di-1,2,4-triazoles lead to the synthesis of an isostructural series of MONTs by adopting a syn conformation between rigid metal chains, with an appropriate anion choice providing a 'capping' of the metal ions, leading to MONT formation.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the choice of metal ion affect the local geometry at the metal center in MONT synthesis?",
      "answer": "The local geometry at the metal center in MONT synthesis depends on the metal ion employed, with Cu(I) centers adopting a tetrahedral geometry, Ag(I) centers adopting a seesaw geometry, and Cu(II) centers adopting a square-pyramidal geometry.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What method is used to control the pore width of the MONTs?",
      "answer": "The pore size of the MONTs is adjusted by changing the central portion of the double-hinged ligand, allowing for a predictable method to control the pore width of the MONT.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "Which MONTs exhibited the highest uptake of CO2 and CH4?",
      "answer": "Copper MONTs exhibited the highest uptake of CO2 and CH4.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the increase in pore width affect the gas uptake and selectivity in silver MONTs?",
      "answer": "In the case of the silver MONTs, an increase in pore width improves both gas uptake and selectivity.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of employing different metals and oxidation states in the synthesis of isostructural MONTs?",
      "answer": "Employing different metals and oxidation states in the synthesis of isostructural MONTs demonstrates the generality of the approach and allows for the synthesis of MONTs with varying properties.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the synthesis approach of MONTs contribute to the field of nanomaterials?",
      "answer": "The synthesis approach of utilizing semirigid ligands and a variety of metals in MONTs represents the first general methodology to prepare this class of 1D nanomaterial, contributing significantly to the development and study of tubular nanomaterials with potential in selective adsorptions.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the local geometry at the metal center in MONT synthesis solely determined by the choice of metal ion?",
      "answer": "True. The local geometry at the metal center in MONT synthesis is determined by the choice of metal ion, with different metals adopting specific geometries.",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can the pore size of MONTs be adjusted without changing the ligand?",
      "answer": "False. The pore size of MONTs is adjusted by changing the central portion of the double-hinged ligand, making ligand modification necessary for pore size control.",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "Does the synthesis of MONTs involve a single-step process?",
      "answer": "False. The synthesis of MONTs involves a multi-step process, including the adjustment of ligands and the choice of metal ions and their oxidation states.",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "Are copper MONTs less effective in gas uptake compared to silver MONTs?",
      "answer": "False. Copper MONTs exhibited the highest uptake of CO2 and CH4, indicating they are more effective in gas uptake compared to silver MONTs.",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "Does the increase in pore width always lead to a decrease in gas selectivity in MONTs?",
      "answer": "False. In the case of silver MONTs, an increase in pore width not only improves gas uptake but also enhances CO2/CH4 selectivity.",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the synthesis of MONTs limited to using only copper and silver metals?",
      "answer": "False. The synthesis approach for MONTs is general, allowing for the use of multiple metal ions in different oxidation states, not limited to just copper and silver.",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    }

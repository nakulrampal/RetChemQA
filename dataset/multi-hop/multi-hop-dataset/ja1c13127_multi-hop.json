    {
      "question": "What is the primary building unit (PBU) composition in the An(IV)-ADC structures?",
      "answer": "Each actinide center is coordinated by six equivalent bidentate carboxylate groups from six deprotonated ADC, defining an ideal icosahedral geometry of the [AnO12] primary building unit (PBU).",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the An-O bond length change across different actinides in An(IV)-ADC MOFs?",
      "answer": "The An-O bond length in the 12-coordinate actinide PBU follows an expected decreasing trend from 2.577 Å (Th) to 2.510 Å (Pu) due to the actinide contraction.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What factors contribute to the coordination saturation of the central actinide in An-MOFs?",
      "answer": "The metal ionic radius, carboxylate bite angle, anthracene plane twisting, interligand interactions, and countercation templating collectively determine an interplay between solvation, modulation, and complexation, resulting in a coordination saturation of the central actinide.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the large coordination number in An-MOFs?",
      "answer": "The large coordination number in An-MOFs is significant because it demonstrates autoluminescence and portends a wide-bandgap semiconducting property with implications for applications such as hard radiation detection.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the coordination number of 12 exclusive to An(IV)-MOFs?",
      "answer": "Yes, actinide centers with a coordination number of 12 are expected to be possible in An-MOFs that display unique structural stability, chemical reactivity, and multifunctionality, but they have not been achieved to date before the An(IV)-ADC MOFs.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does the countercation play in the structure of An-MOFs?",
      "answer": "The countercation plays a structure-directing role for the anionic actinide-carboxylate monomers, influencing the composition of monomeric molecular complexes and contributing to the stability of the MOF structure.",

      "type": "reasoning"

    {
      "question": "How does the synthesis condition affect the crystal size of Th(IV)-ADC?",
      "answer": "The synthesis condition, specifically the amount of modulator used, affects the crystal size of Th(IV)-ADC, with a larger amount of modulator contributing to bigger crystals on average.",

    {
      "question": "Can Ln(III, IV) form a 12-coordinate PBU in MOFs similar to An(IV)-ADC?",
      "answer": "No, Ln(III, IV) assemble into an eight- or nine-coordinate Ln-ADC dimer, while U(III) forms a framework near identical to U(IV)-ADC, implying that a majority of U(III) is in situ oxidized to U(IV) due to high reactivity.",

      "type": "True or False"

    {
      "question": "What experimental techniques were used to characterize the An(IV)-ADC MOFs?",
      "answer": "Techniques such as single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SC-XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), UV-Vis diffuse reflection spectroscopy (DRS), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA-DSC), and gas adsorption-desorption tests were used to characterize the An(IV)-ADC MOFs.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the impact of actinide contraction on the An-MOFs' structure?",
      "answer": "Actinide contraction impacts the An-MOFs' structure by causing a decreasing trend in the An-O bond length across different actinides, which influences the MOFs' stability, reactivity, and potential applications.",

      "question": "What is the effect of adding Ba2+ ions to the solution of [Ru(tBu2bipy)(CN)4]2- in MeCN?",
      "answer": "Adding Ba2+ ions to the solution of [Ru(tBu2bipy)(CN)4]2- in MeCN results in a substantial increase in its luminescence energy, intensity, and lifetime.",

    {
      "question": "How does the interaction of [Ru(bipy)(CN)4]2- with metal cations vary in the solid state based on the cation's size and charge?",
      "answer": "In the solid state, 'harder' metal cations favor end-on cyanide bridges, and 'softer' cations favor side-on interactions with cyanides, depending on the size and charge of the metal ion.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What phenomenon is observed when [Ru(bipy)(CN)4]2- interacts with additional metal cations both in the solid state and in solution?",
      "answer": "The interaction of [Ru(bipy)(CN)4]2- with additional metal cations both in the solid state and in solution results in a blue-shift of the 1MLCT absorptions and the appearance of strong 3MLCT luminescence, a phenomenon known as 'metallochromism'.",

      "question": "What is the role of Ba2+ ions in the photoinduced energy transfer process within the [Ru(bipy)3]2+/[Ru(bipy)(CN)4]2- dyad?",
      "answer": "Ba2+ ions increase the excited-state energy of the [Ru(bipy)(CN)4]2- terminus, reversing the direction of photoinduced energy transfer (PEnT) within the dyad.",

      "question": "How does the presence of water affect the absorption spectrum of [Ru(bipy)(CN)4]2- in 'anhydrous' solvents?",
      "answer": "The presence of tiny traces of water in 'anhydrous' solvents affects the absorption spectrum of [Ru(bipy)(CN)4]2- due to preferential solvation of the anion by the hydrogen-bonding water molecules.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The interaction of [Ru(bipy)(CN)4]2- with Cs+ ions in solution results in a decrease in luminescence intensity.",

    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the 'metallochromic' effect in the context of [Ru(bipy)(CN)4]2- interactions?",
      "answer": "The 'metallochromic' effect, which involves changes in luminescence due to interactions with metal cations, suggests potential applications of [Ru(bipy)(CN)4]2- derivatives as luminescent sensors and for controlling the flow of excited-state energy in polynuclear assemblies.",

      "question": "How does the crystal structure of Na2[Ru(bipy)(CN)4]•(H2O)9 differ from that of Li2[Ru(bipy)(CN)4]•(H2O)6?",
      "answer": "The crystal structure of Na2[Ru(bipy)(CN)4]•(H2O)9 involves both end-on and side-on cyanide ligation to Na+ ions and displays substantial disorder of the Na+ ions and most of their associated water ligands, whereas Li2[Ru(bipy)(CN)4]•(H2O)6 primarily features end-on Ru-CN-Li bridges.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What strategy was demonstrated to boost CO2/C2H2 selectivity in porous coordination polymers?",
      "answer": "An 'opposite action' strategy was demonstrated, which involves synergically increasing CO2 affinity and suppressing C2H2 adsorption through precise steric arrangement of interaction sites on the pore surface.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How were the PCP isomers PCP-ipa and PCP-bdc synthesized, and what was unique about their structure?",
      "answer": "PCP-ipa and PCP-bdc were synthesized via the solvothermal reaction, and they exhibited analogous crystal structures due to the similar coordination environment of Co, resulting in a similar narrow 1D channel of the p ligand system.",

    {
      "question": "What was the effect of incorporating amino groups into the bdc/ipa ligands on CO2 and C2H2 adsorption?",
      "answer": "Incorporating amino groups into the bdc/ipa ligands resulted in PCP-NH2-ipa and PCP-NH2-bdc showing obvious preferential adsorption of CO2 over C2H2 at ambient temperatures, indicating lesser number of binding sites for C2H2.",

      "question": "What were the key findings from the theoretical calculations of CO2 and C2H2 adsorption into PCP-NH2-bdc and PCP-bdc?",
      "answer": "Theoretical calculations showed that PCP-NH2-bdc has a stronger affinity towards CO2 compared to PCP-bdc due to the presence of the -NH2 group, and it also showed suppressed C2H2 adsorption, consistent with the experimental findings.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What was the role of the -NH2 group in the adsorption process according to the study?",
      "answer": "The -NH2 group enhanced CO2-framework interactions without apparently changing the orientation of the gas molecules for CO2, while it suppressed C2H2 adsorption by changing the adsorption position and driving out some of the adsorbed C2H2 molecules.",
      "difficulty": "hard",

    },
    {
      "question": "Based on the study, what makes PCP-NH2-ipa and PCP-NH2-bdc potential candidates for trapping CO2 from CO2/C2H2 gas mixtures?",
      "answer": "PCP-NH2-ipa and PCP-NH2-bdc are potential candidates for trapping CO2 from CO2/C2H2 gas mixtures due to their high CO2 uptake capacity, high CO2/C2H2 uptake ratio at 298 K, and their remarkable stability and recyclability.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How did the 'opposite action' strategy contribute to the inverse selectivity for CO2/C2H2 separation?",
      "answer": "The 'opposite action' strategy contributed to the inverse selectivity by precisely positioning additional interacting sites parallel to CO2 binding sites, which allowed enhanced CO2-framework interactions and suppressed C2H2 adsorption due to space limitations.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What were the implications of the isosteric heat of adsorption (Qst) values for CO2 and C2H2 on the desorption process?",
      "answer": "The Qst values indicated that the desorption process by PCP-NH2-ipa and PCP-NH2-bdc is less energy consuming compared to previously reported PCP adsorbents, which is beneficial for practical applications.",

      "question": "How did the study verify the 'opposite action' strategy for boosting CO2/C2H2 selectivity?",
      "answer": "The study verified the 'opposite action' strategy through theoretical calculations and experimental findings that showed enhanced CO2 adsorption and suppressed C2H2 adsorption in PCP-NH2-bdc and PCP-NH2-ipa, consistent with the strategy's objectives.",

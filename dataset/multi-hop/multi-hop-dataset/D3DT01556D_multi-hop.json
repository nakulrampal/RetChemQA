      "question": "What are the synthesis conditions for the coordination compounds derived from the reaction of copper(II) bromide with bmtte?",
      "answer": "The synthesis conditions involved using different synthetic methods, times, temperatures, and solvents to obtain a broad overview of the system, leading to the isolation of four single crystals: two 2D polymorphs (1m and 1t) of 2 1Cu2Br4(bmtte) and two 0D polynuclear complexes, namely the trinuclear [Cu3Br4(bmtte)2] (2) and the tetranuclear [Cu2Br2(bmtte)]2 (3).",

      "question": "How does the reaction condition influence the formation of Cu(I)/Cu(II) mixed-valence cluster 2?",
      "answer": "The Cu(I)/Cu(II) mixed-valence cluster 2 could be obtained as a pure phase when the reaction was performed with the same molar ratio and solvent but with stirring at room temperature for 13 days.",

      "question": "Is the reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I) always observed under hydrothermal or solvothermal conditions?",
      "answer": "No, compounds 2 and 3 are the first cases in which the Cu(II) to Cu(I) reduction has been observed under mild synthetic conditions, using equimolar reactant ratios, without a protic solvent in the medium and with no apparent decomposition of the ligand.",

    {
      "question": "What role does the bmtte ligand play in the formation of the trinuclear and tetranuclear compounds?",
      "answer": "In the trinuclear compound 2, the bmtte ligand acts as a bis-monodentate bridge linking Cu1 and Cu2 through the tetrazole fragment to form five-membered rings (Cu2N2Br) and as a bidentate chelating unit with Cu1 to give a nine-membered ring (CuN2S2C4). In the tetranuclear compound 3, the bmtte ligand uses three nitrogen atoms of the two tetrazole rings to coordinate metal centres in a similar coordination mode.",

      "question": "What is the impact of water on the stability of compounds 1m, 1t, 2, and 3?",
      "answer": "Compounds 1m, 1t, and 2 showed rapid evolution in contact with water, becoming colorless, whereas compound 3 showed some degree of instability but retained its structure after exposure to water.",

      "question": "Can the mixed-valence compound 2 evolve into species that contain only Cu(II) or Cu(I) upon treatment with CuBr2 and KI?",
      "answer": "Yes, the mixed-valence compound 2 evolved into the Cu(II) 2D polymer upon treatment with an excess of CuBr2, and into the Cu(I) 2D coordination polymer 2 1Cu4I4(bmtte) (4) upon solid-state reaction with KI.",

      "question": "What are the electrochemical behaviors of complexes 2 and 3 in DMSO solution?",
      "answer": "Both complexes 2 and 3 displayed similar redox behaviors with two consecutive oxidation waves in the anodic direction and several reductions on the cathodic side, attributed to metal-based electron transfer reactions involving the redox couples Cu(I)/Cu(II) and Cu(II)/Cu(III).",

      "question": "Does the presence of water as a solvent influence the occurrence of chemical reactions in the synthesis of copper complexes?",
      "answer": "Yes, the presence of water as a solvent has been observed to be responsible for the occurrence of chemical reactions, such as the in situ reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I), during the synthesis of copper complexes.",

      "question": "What structural feature is common among the coordination compounds synthesized from copper(II) bromide and bmtte?",
      "answer": "A common structural feature among the coordination compounds is the presence of the flexible polydentate bmtte ligand, which supports copper complexes with different oxidation states and shows flexibility in adopting different coordination modes.",

      "question": "How does the coordination behavior of the bmtte ligand differ in the formation of the 2D coordination polymers and the discrete trinuclear and tetranuclear compounds?",
      "answer": "In the 2D coordination polymers, the bmtte ligand acts as a bridge linking metal clusters, while in the discrete trinuclear and tetranuclear compounds, it exhibits a bis-monodentate bridging and bidentate chelating coordination behavior, respectively, demonstrating its versatility in stabilizing different copper complex structures.",

      "question": "What are the synthesis conditions for UMCM-151?",
      "answer": "Linker H2 2 (0.050 g, 0.14 mmol) was added to a solution of DMF/dioxane/H2O (4:1:1, 10 mL) in a 20-mL scintillation vial. To this mixture was added Cu(NO3)2·2.5H2O (0.096 g, 0.41 mmol), and the contents were sonicated until dissolved and then heated at 85 °C. After 12 h, the mother liquor was decanted and replaced with fresh DMF/dioxane/H2O (4:1:1). The blue crystals were exchanged twice in DMF and five times in acetone. The material was dried under vacuum at room temperature for 4 h in which time the crystals turned green. The yield of the reaction based upon the weight of the solvent-free material is 80% based upon H3 2.",

    {
      "question": "What distinguishes the metal cluster present in UMCM-154 from more common clusters?",
      "answer": "The metal cluster present in UMCM-154 is uncommon, consisting of a three-bladed zinc paddlewheel with three carboxylates coordinated to two tetrahedral zinc ions and an additional two carboxylates coordinated to the axial positions. This formation is attributed to the thermodynamic requirements imposed by linker 4 having five carboxylates in a 1:4 symmetry equivalent ratio.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does the synthesis of UMCM-152 differ from UMCM-153?",
      "answer": "UMCM-152 can be formed as a pure phase through the addition of 0.005 M HCl to the reaction solution, and UMCM-153 can be produced pure from a mixture of 4:1:1 N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP)/dioxane/H2O.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of reduced symmetry linkers in the synthesis of coordination polymers?",
      "answer": "Reduced symmetry linkers can drive new modes of assembly, create different networks due to supramolecular isomerism imparted by varying coordination modes of chemically distinct carboxylates, and lead to highly porous materials lacking interpenetration, making them important building blocks in the synthesis of a new generation of porous materials.",

      "question": "True or False: The equilibrium adsorption capacity for large molecules in the liquid phase is directly credited to effects of pore size and shape.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What causes the structural collapse of UMCM-151 upon guest removal?",
      "answer": "The structural collapse of UMCM-151 upon guest removal is attributed to the 3-nm channels within UMCM-151, suggesting that three carboxylate groups cannot provide enough junction points for the m-terphenyl linker, 2, to coordinate with Cu paddlewheels in a stable conformation.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How do UMCM-152 and UMCM-153 demonstrate the effect of framework structure on adsorption capacities?",
      "answer": "UMCM-152 and UMCM-153, having the same building block units and nearly identical surface areas, exhibit dramatically different capacities for dibenzothiophene (DBT) and 4,6-dimethyldibenzothiophene (DMDBT), providing evidence that liquid phase adsorption is dependent on pore size and shape rather than surface area or linker/metal cluster identity alone.",

    {
      "question": "What synthesis strategy is inspired by isophthalate-based MCPs to overcome low structural rigidity in UMCM-151?",
      "answer": "The strategy inspired by isophthalate-based MCPs to overcome low structural rigidity in UMCM-151 involves maintaining reduced symmetry while increasing the ratio of benzene rings to carboxylates to 1 or greater, as demonstrated by the design of ligand 3, a C2v tetracarboxylate precursor.",

    {
      "question": "How does the presence of a trinuclear cluster in UMCM-150 contribute to its structural motif?",
      "answer": "The presence of a trinuclear cluster with the formula Cu3(CO2R)6 in UMCM-150 contributes to an uncommon structural motif, where segregation occurs among chemically distinct carboxylates with isophthalate carboxylates assembling into Cu paddlewheels and p-benzoate groups forming a new mode of assembly, a Cu3(CO2R)6 cluster.",

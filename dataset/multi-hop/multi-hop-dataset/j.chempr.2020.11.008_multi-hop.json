      "question": "What is the main driving force for the topology transition in Spiro-CE-1?",
      "answer": "The main driving force for the topology transition in Spiro-CE-1 is the subtle topological strain in the crystal lattice of Spiro-CE-1, along with the highly flexible 18-crown-6-ether moieties that may trigger the transition process by providing sufficient initial energy through drastic vibrations.",

      "question": "What are the key steps involved in the topology transition from Spiro-CE-1 to Spiro-CE-2?",
      "answer": "The key steps involved in the topology transition from Spiro-CE-1 to Spiro-CE-2 are: 1) regioselective linker deformation and Zrâ€“O bonds cleavage, 2) ordered linker elimination and oriented crystal lattice contraction, and 3) Zr6 cluster dimerization and framework formation.",

    {
      "question": "What experimental evidence supports the hypothesis that the vibration of 18-crown-6-ether moieties triggers the topology transition in Spiro-CE-1?",
      "answer": "Experimental evidence supporting the hypothesis includes the remarkable deformations of the 18-crown-6-ether moieties observed in structural analyses, the independence of transition rates from solvent types, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and the stability of the Spiro-CE-1-K adducts which restrict the vibrational motion of the 18-crown-6-ether moieties.",

    {
      "question": "What challenges are associated with achieving a topology transition in Zr6-based metal-organic frameworks, and how were they addressed in the study of Spiro-CE-1?",
      "answer": "Challenges include controlling the location (regioselectivity) of any weakness in the crystal lattices and maintaining crystallinity during the transition. These were addressed by introducing topological strain and flexible 18-crown-6-ether moieties into Spiro-CE-1, enabling a regioselective linker elimination and transition in a single-crystal to single-crystal manner.",

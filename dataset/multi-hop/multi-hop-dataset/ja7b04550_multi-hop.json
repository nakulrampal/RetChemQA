      "question": "What is the main goal of the study described in the article?",
      "answer": "The main goal of the study is to develop robust, strongly luminescent, and highly dispersible hybrid materials by combining ionic and coordinate bonds in molecular crystals for clean/renewable energy related applications.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What unique approach is introduced in the synthesis of hybrid materials in the study?",
      "answer": "The study introduces an 'all-in-one' (AIO) approach that allows the formation of both ionic and coordinate bonds within a molecular cluster, enhancing structural stability while maintaining high luminescence efficiency.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How do the AIO structures compare to other CuI-based hybrid structures in terms of thermal stability?",
      "answer": "The AIO structures exhibit greatly enhanced thermal stability, with decomposition temperatures as high as 300°C, which is significantly higher than other CuI-based charge-neutral molecular clusters that generally decompose below 80°C.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the main advantages of the AIO structures over other types of copper iodide-based hybrid phosphors?",
      "answer": "The AIO structures offer several advantages including optical tunability, high quantum efficiency, excellent thermal and photostability, and solution dispersibility/processability, making them excellent candidates as lighting phosphors.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What experimental techniques were used to investigate the luminescence origin and emission mechanism of the materials?",
      "answer": "Temperature-dependent photoluminescence experiments and DFT (Density Functional Theory) calculations were performed to investigate the luminescence origin and emission mechanism of the materials.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The AIO approach only allows the formation of ionic bonds within a molecular cluster.",
      "answer": "False",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The AIO structures are only suitable for applications in clean/renewable energy and cannot be used in lighting phosphors.",
      "answer": "False",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role do metal–ligand bonds play in the electron transfer process of AIO compounds?",
      "answer": "Metal–ligand bonds play a vital role in the electron transfer process upon excitation of AIO compounds, contributing to their high luminescence efficiency.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the emission mechanism of subgroup II AIO compounds differ from that of subgroup I?",
      "answer": "Subgroup II AIO compounds exhibit an emission mechanism that is likely a combination of both thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and phosphorescence, due to small singlet to triplet energy differences, whereas subgroup I compounds mainly exhibit phosphorescence.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The AIO structures have poor solution processability and cannot form high-quality films.",
      "answer": "False",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"

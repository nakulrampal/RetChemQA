      "question": "How does the adsorption behavior of coordination polymers 1 and 2 differ despite their similar prototype structures?",
      "answer": "Despite their similar prototype structures, coordination polymers 1 and 2 exhibit distinct adsorption/desorption behavior due to the slight difference in the spacer groups (-N=N-/-CH=CH-) found between azpy and bpee.",

    {
      "question": "What phenomenon is attributed to the expansion of 1a relative to 1?",

    },
    {
      "question": "Why does the interlayer distance of 2 decrease upon the removal of water molecules?",
      "answer": "The interlayer distance of 2 decreases upon the removal of water molecules due to the hydrogen-bonding interaction between the pendant oxygen atoms and ethylene hydrogen atoms, resulting in a more closely packed structure.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the adsorption selectivity exhibited by 2a?",
      "answer": "The adsorption selectivity exhibited by 2a is significant because it selectively adsorbs H2O and MeOH due to the small aperture of the channels, which may find useful applications in molecular separation techniques.",

      "question": "Why are N2 molecules unable to diffuse into the micropores of 1a at 77 K?",
      "answer": "N2 molecules are unable to diffuse into the micropores of 1a at 77 K because only surface adsorption occurs, indicating that the N2 molecules cannot penetrate the channel at low temperature.",

    {
      "question": "What is the role of hydrogen bonding in the structure of 2 before and after dehydration?",
      "answer": "Before dehydration, hydrogen bonds accommodate water molecules in the structure of 2. After dehydration, hydrogen-bonding interaction between pendant oxygen atoms and ethylene hydrogen atoms leads to a more closely packed structure, responsible for the shrinking.",

      "answer": "The adsorption behavior of 1a for different molecules at 298 K, showing hysteretic adsorption for H2O, MeOH, EtOH, THF, and Me2CO, demonstrates its microporous nature by allowing diffusion into the micropores irrespective of molecular size similarities to N2.",

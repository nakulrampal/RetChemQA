      "question": "What is the effect of crystal downsizing on the structural flexibility of coordination frameworks?",
      "answer": "Crystal downsizing regulates the structural flexibility of coordination frameworks and induces a shape-memory effect, where a metastable open dried phase can be isolated when the crystals are downsized to the mesoscale.",

    {
      "question": "How does the crystal size of [Cu2(bdc)2(bpy)]n affect its sorption properties?",

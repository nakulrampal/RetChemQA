      "question": "What is the highest light-induced magnetic ordering temperature observed for the coordination polymer discussed in the text?",
      "answer": "93 K",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of water sorption in controlling the photomagnetic functionality of the discussed coordination polymer?",
      "answer": "The photoswitching observed in the anhydrous state is completely quenched by the reversible capture of water, with the fully hydrated phase becoming practically non-photomagnetic.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the structural transformation between 1-8H2O and 1 occur?",
      "answer": "The structural transformation occurs through vacuum dehydration of 1-8H2O, which leads to the removal of water molecules and results in the formation of 1.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the photomagnetic effect in the discussed coordination polymer reversible, and what indicates this?",
      "answer": "Yes, the photomagnetic effect is reversible. This is indicated by the IR spectra changes during irradiation at 90 K and the complete disappearance of the new broad band between 2400 and 2200 cm-1 after thermal relaxation.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The coordination polymer exhibits photomagnetic behavior only in its hydrated form.",
      "answer": "False",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What experimental technique was used to study changes occurring during the blue light irradiation of the coordination polymer at low temperature?",
      "answer": "IR spectroscopy",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens to the cyanide stretching bands of the coordination polymer upon cooling to 90 K?",
      "answer": "The cyanide stretching bands become sharper, better resolved, and are blueshifted by approximately 5 cm-1.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The dehydration and rehydration process of the coordination polymer does not affect its crystal structure.",
      "answer": "False",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the effect of 450 nm light irradiation on the IR spectra of the coordination polymer at 90 K?",
      "answer": "The irradiation leads to the appearance of a new broad band between 2400 and 2200 cm-1 and the widening and decrease in intensity of the original CN-stretching vibration band.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The photomagnetic behavior of the coordination polymer is independent of its water content.",
      "answer": "False",

      "type": "True or False"

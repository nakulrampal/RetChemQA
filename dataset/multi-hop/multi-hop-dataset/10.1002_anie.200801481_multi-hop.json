      "question": "How does the solvent–solute effect influence the generation of supramolecular chirality?",

    },
    {
      "question": "Why are the two polymorphs 2a and 2b not interconvertible?",

      "question": "What distinguishes the helical structure of compound 3 from those of 2a and 2b?",
      "answer": "Compound 3 has a 21 screw axis similar to 2b, but its intermolecular interactions and the highly distorted tetrahedral environment of the zinc(II) centers lead to the shortest helical pitch of 7.8 =, making its packing fashion different.",

    {
      "question": "What is the role of water molecules in the ethanol/water mixed solvent system regarding spontaneous resolution?",
      "answer": "Water molecules electrostatically surround the hydroxy groups of the ethanol molecules, increasing the effective size of the polar substituents and enforcing the steric repulsion effect toward dense packing.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does the introduction of a para-methyl group to the phenyl ring affect the solvothermal reaction outcome?",

    },
    {
      "question": "Are the two polymorphs 2a and 2b interconvertible?",

    {
      "question": "Does the presence of solvent molecules in the crystal packing of 2a and 2b complicate the supramolecular interactions among chiral precursors?",

      "question": "Are the solvent–solute effects the only factors considered in the generation of supramolecular chirality?",

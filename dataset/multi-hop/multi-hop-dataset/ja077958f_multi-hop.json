          "question": "What is the primary focus of the study conducted by Neville et al.?",
          "answer": "The study focuses on the synthesis, structural, and magnetic characterization of the SCOF Fe(NCS)2(bped)2·3EtOH, SCOF-3(Et), and its desolvated analogue Fe(NCS)2(bped)2, SCOF-3, exploring their single-crystal to single-crystal transformation and photomagnetic properties.",

          "question": "What significant structural change is observed in the transition from SCOF-3(Et) to SCOF-3?",
          "answer": "The most significant structural change is an increase in the interpenetration angle of the two-dimensional grids from 85.2 to 90°, with the symmetry increasing from primitive orthorhombic (Pccn) to body-centered tetragonal (I4/mcm).",

          "answer": "Desolvation from SCOF-3(Et) to SCOF-3 results in a stabilization of the low-spin state, evidenced by an increase in the onset of SCO, and a broader SCO transition with a greater residual high-spin fraction at low temperature.",

      "question": "What is the primary function of the Co-based porous coordination polymer (PCP) with VTTF ligands?",
      "answer": "The primary function of the Co-based PCP with VTTF ligands is to exhibit exclusive gate opening for ethylene, enabling the discriminatory adsorption of ethylene over ethane.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does the Co-based PCP recognize ethylene and discriminate it from ethane?",
      "answer": "The Co-based PCP recognizes ethylene via d−π complexation on the accessible metal site that displaces and cleaves the Co–S bond to unlock the closed structure, facilitating ethylene-triggered unlocking and remarkable nonporous-to-porous transformations. Ethane does not open the gate because it is unable to coordinate to the Co center.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What role do the hemilabile Co–S cross-links play in the functionality of the Co-based PCP?",
      "answer": "The hemilabile Co–S cross-links act as a lock in the Co-based PCP, and only ethylene can act as the key to disrupt this bond by displacing it with itself, triggering the gate-opening mechanism.",

      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the Co-based PCP's structure change in response to ethylene adsorption?",
      "answer": "In response to ethylene adsorption, the Co-based PCP undergoes a two-step gate-opening process, transitioning from a closed to a half-open and then to a fully open structure, as characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis.",

      "question": "What is the significance of the Co–S bond length observed in the evacuated state of the Co-based PCP?",
      "answer": "The Co–S bond length observed in the evacuated state of the Co-based PCP indicates the formation of a bond between the Co and the sulfur atom of the VTTF ligand, which plays a crucial role in stabilizing the evacuated nonporous phase and is key to the PCP's selective adsorption mechanism.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"

      "question": "How does the temperature affect the gate-opening pressure of the Co-based PCP for ethylene adsorption?",
      "answer": "The gate-opening pressure of the Co-based PCP for ethylene adsorption increases with increasing temperature, as interactions between the gas molecules and the framework decrease, requiring a higher energy gain to balance framework deformation.",

      "question": "What is the role of d-camphoric acid in the synthesis of homochiral materials?",
      "answer": "D-camphoric acid (d-cam) is used as an enantiopure chiral ligand to induce chirality in the framework, acting as a linker between tetrahedral nodes.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the synthesis condition differ for crystal 4 compared to crystal 3?",
      "answer": "Crystal 4 is favored under lower temperature (100 8C) and shorter reaction time (36 h), whereas crystal 3 is favored under higher temperature (160 8C) and potentially longer reaction times.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the Flack parameter in the context of crystal 4?",
      "answer": "The Flack parameter values for crystal 4 indicate that there is no racemization of the enantiopure ligand during hydrothermal synthesis, confirming the homochirality of the material.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why can't crystals 4 and 5 be distinguished using X-ray powder diffraction?",
      "answer": "Crystals 4 and 5 cannot be distinguished using X-ray powder diffraction because they have nearly identical unit cell parameters and crystal structures.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What transformation occurs when crystal 1 is heated at 100 8C?",
      "answer": "When crystal 1 is heated at 100 8C, it undergoes a single-crystal to single-crystal transformation to form crystal 2, losing two water molecules in the process.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the synthesis of crystal 5 differ from that of crystal 4?",
      "answer": "The synthesis of crystal 5 differs from that of crystal 4 in that dl-camphoric acid (racemic mixture) is used instead of d-camphoric acid (enantiopure), resulting in an achiral framework.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the effect of using enantiopure versus racemic ligands on the crystallization of homochiral solids?",
      "answer": "Using enantiopure ligands usually results in homochiral solids with different topological features compared to those prepared from racemic ligands, due to differing symmetry requirements.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the flexibility of the chiral framework affect the phase transitions observed in crystals 1, 2, and 3?",
      "answer": "The flexibility of the chiral framework allows for the compression or stretching of helices during phase transformations, leading to significant changes in the helical pitch and unit cell volume.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is the synthesis of homochiral 3D frameworks with four-connected topology considered rare?",
      "answer": "The synthesis of homochiral 3D frameworks with four-connected topology is considered rare due to the challenges in inducing chirality in frameworks that are typically achiral, such as those based on the diamond net.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does the temperature play in the synthesis of crystals 3 and 4?",
      "answer": "Temperature influences the relative stability and thus the formation of crystals 3 and 4, with higher temperatures favoring the formation of crystal 3 and lower temperatures favoring crystal 4.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the loss of water molecules from crystal 1 to crystal 2 affect the structure?",
      "answer": "The loss of two water molecules from crystal 1 to crystal 2 leads to a shrinkage of the helices and a decrease in the volume of the unit cell, indicating a structural transformation.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the nearly identical unit cell parameters between homochiral 4 and achiral 5?",
      "answer": "The nearly identical unit cell parameters between homochiral 4 and achiral 5 demonstrate the possibility of maintaining the same crystal structure while switching the chirality of the 3D framework.",

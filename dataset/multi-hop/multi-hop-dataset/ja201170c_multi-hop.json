      "question": "What are the synthesis conditions for the 2D and 3D PCPs described in the text?",
      "answer": "The 2D and 3D PCPs are synthesized by a similar procedure where a pure alcohol is added onto an aqueous solution of Cu(OTf)2, followed by layering an ethanolic solution of bpy over this solution. For 2D PCPs, methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, and 1-buthanol are used as the interlayer phase, resulting in blue crystals named 1-4 respectively. For 3D PCPs, 1-hexanol and 1-octanol are used as the interlayer phase, resulting in blue crystals named 5 and 6. Additionally, a 3D PCP named 7 can be obtained with a water–DMSO system.",

      "question": "How do the adsorption isotherms of N2, CO2, and Ar on the 2D PCP differ from those on the 3D PCP?",
      "answer": "The adsorption isotherms of N2, CO2, and Ar on the 2D PCP show stepwise structures with wide ranges of hysteresis loops, indicating a dynamic structural change associated with gas adsorption. In contrast, the 3D PCP exhibits type I adsorption isotherms without definite steps, indicating uniform micropores and less framework flexibility compared to the 2D PCP.",

    {
      "question": "True or False: The 2D PCP can accommodate a larger amount of guest molecules than its inherent crystallographic void volume through framework structural changes.",
      "answer": "True",

      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What phenomenon is suggested by the unique stepwise gas adsorption isotherms observed for the 2D PCP?",
      "answer": "The unique stepwise gas adsorption isotherms observed for the 2D PCP suggest an explicit structure expansion of the 2D square-grid sheets upon accommodation of guest molecules, indicating a remarkable framework flexibility and adaptability to different gases.",

    {
      "question": "What is the role of the intermediate solvent in the synthesis of 2D and 3D PCPs?",
      "answer": "The intermediate solvent plays a crucial role in determining the dimensionality of the resulting PCP. For 2D PCPs, alcohols with shorter carbon chains (methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, and 1-buthanol) are used, while for 3D PCPs, alcohols with longer carbon chains (1-hexanol and 1-octanol) or a water–DMSO system are used. This choice of solvent influences the assembly of Cu(II) ions and bpy ligands into either 2D or 3D frameworks.",

      "question": "True or False: The 3D PCP exhibits selective adsorption due to molecular sieving effect and quadrupole–hydrophilic surface interaction.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does the adsorption capacity of the 2D PCP for CO2 and Ar compare to that of the 3D PCP?",
      "answer": "The adsorption capacity of the 2D PCP for CO2 and Ar is more than twice that of the 3D PCP, despite the 2D PCP having less than half of the void volume of the 3D PCP in its guest-free state. This is attributed to the 2D PCP's ability to undergo dynamic structural changes to accommodate larger amounts of guest molecules.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What structural changes occur in the 2D PCP upon adsorption of different gases?",
      "answer": "Upon adsorption of different gases, the 2D PCP undergoes characteristic structure transformations depending on the nature of the adsorbing guests. Synchrotron XRD patterns reveal that the structure of the 2D PCP changes in sequence with CO2 accommodation at 196 K, and the interlayer distances and distortion of the 2D square-grid are different for each adsorbed gas, indicating a variety of structural states.",

      "question": "True or False: The adsorption isotherms of methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, and water on the 2D PCP at 303 K show definite folding points.",

      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What factors contribute to the framework dimensionality-dependent gas adsorptivities observed in the 2D and 3D PCPs?",
      "answer": "The framework dimensionality-dependent gas adsorptivities observed in the 2D and 3D PCPs are contributed by the difference in framework flexibility, the molecular sieving effect, quadrupole–hydrophilic surface interaction, and the ability of the 2D PCP to undergo dynamic structural changes to accommodate larger amounts of guest molecules than its inherent crystallographic void volume.",

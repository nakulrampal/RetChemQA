    },
    {
      "question": "Which cation is located at the center of the clamlike structure formed by ctc-derived anions?",
      "answer": "A 'bare', unsolvated Rb+ ion",

    },
    {
      "question": "What prevents the formation of a clam-type structure with K+ ions?",
      "answer": "The K+ cation is too small to fit snugly into the interior of the closed clam.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the environment of the Rb+ ion in the clamlike structure compare to its immediate environment in other compounds?",
      "answer": "In the clamlike structure, Rb+ prefers to associate with carbon p systems rather than water or phenolic groups, which is remarkable given the presence of water.",

      "question": "What is the result of attempting to form a clam-type structure with Cs+ ions?",

    {
      "question": "What distinguishes the clamlike units in the compound obtained from ctc.H6, NMe4Cl, and excess ammonia in aqueous acetone?",
      "answer": "These clams are partially opened to accommodate the larger NMe4+ ion, with the hinge of the opened clam provided by two equivalent hydrogen bonds.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does the use of K+ cation fail to give a clam, according to the text?",
      "answer": "Because the K+ cation is too small, whereas larger NMe4+ cations give 'opened up' clams.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role do external guanidinium cations play in the structure containing the clamlike [Rb(ctc.H5)(ctc.H4)]2- ion?",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the presence of water affect the preference of Rb+ to associate with carbon p systems?",
      "answer": "Despite the presence of water, Rb+ shows a remarkable preference for a carbon environment, which is unusual given the compounds are generated in media containing approximately 50% H2O.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the dihedral angles in the clam units containing NEt4+ ions?",
      "answer": "The dihedral angles indicate that clams C and D are opened up much wider than clams A and B to accommodate the larger NEt4+ ion.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What does the unsuccessful attempt to form a clam-type structure with K+ ions suggest about the size compatibility of cations with the clam interior?",
      "answer": "It suggests that the size of the cation is crucial for the formation of a clam-type structure, with K+ being too small.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How do the clamlike units survive or change when the above solids are dissolved?",
      "answer": "ESMS studies suggest that the clamlike units survive in solution when the solids are dissolved and that the clams self-assemble when the components are mixed in solution.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },

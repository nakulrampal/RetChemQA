    },
    {
      "question": "Why is the phenomenon of the framework shrinking upon guest inclusion and expanding upon guest release considered unusual?",
      "answer": "This behavior is considered unusual because it is contrary to common host–guest materials, where typically the framework expands upon guest inclusion to accommodate the guest molecules.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does the structural flexibility of the metal–organic framework affect its gas sorption properties?",

      "question": "How does the inclusion of benzene affect the structure of the metal–organic framework compared to its guest-free form?",
      "answer": "The inclusion of benzene leads to the formation of a 2D rhombic grid, with the distance between Zn2 units similar to the guest-free framework but with a smaller specific volume per Zn2 unit.",

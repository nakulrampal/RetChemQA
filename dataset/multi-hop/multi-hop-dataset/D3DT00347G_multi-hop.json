    },
    {
      "question": "How does the coordination geometry of the cobalt atom in complex 1 compare to that in complex 4?",
      "answer": "In complex 1, the cobalt atom has a trigonal bipyramidal geometry, while in complex 4, it has a highly distorted tetrahedral geometry.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"

    {
      "question": "True or False: The electronic structure analysis revealed that the spin density is mainly located at the CoII centers for all four complexes 1-4.",
      "answer": "True",

      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What method was used to synthesize the new N4-tetradentate ligand, and what was the unexpected result of the synthesis?",
      "answer": "The synthesis used a Zn-based template synthesis method, and unexpectedly, instead of the targeted alkyl-BIAN, a new ligand with an intramolecular C–C bond was formed.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the typical g-factor values observed in the EPR spectra for the powder samples of complexes 1-4 at 10 K?",
      "answer": "For complex 1, g-values are around 8.04, 5.87, 3.17, and 1.91; for complex 2, they are 8.74, 5.27, 2.86, and 2.25; for complex 3, they are 9.93, 5.23, 2.46, and 1.94; and for complex 4, the g-value is 2.16.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the electronic structure of complex 4 differ from that of complexes 1-3, based on magnetic and EPR data?",
      "answer": "Complex 4 has a spin state of S = 1/2 according to EPR and magnetic data, indicating strong antiferromagnetic coupling between the spins of the CoII ion and the anion-radicals, whereas complexes 1-3 have a high-spin state with S = 3/2 for the CoII ions.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"

      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the outcome of the electrochemical reduction of complex 2 in terms of its optical properties compared to complex 4?",
      "answer": "The outcome of the electrochemical reduction of complex 2 results in a cobalt complex characterized by UV/vis spectra identical to those of complex 4.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The coordination of cobalt(II) toward the N4-ligand results in complexes with only "front" ligand orientations.",

      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What unique feature is observed in the bond lengths of the diimine moiety when comparing the neutral form of the ligand to its anion-radical state?",
      "answer": "The transition from the neutral to the anion-radical form leads to C–N bond lengthening and C–C bond shortening, which is consistent with the formal population of the π* orbitals.",

      "question": "What is the impact of pH on the formation of helices in the synthesis of [Tb(R- or S-pempH)3]∙2H2O?",
      "answer": "The pH of the reaction mixture is essential for the formation of the helices. At pH approximately 3.1, both neutral and positively charged chains coexist in the same reaction solution, with the former being the dominant species. The binding of the positively charged chains to the neutral ones triggers the twist of chain growth, leading to the formation of R-1 with a 1D helical morphology.",

      "question": "How does the presence of NO3- ions influence the formation of helices in the synthesis of [Tb(R- or S-pempH)3]∙2H2O?",
      "answer": "NO3- ions serve as spacers and hydrogen bond acceptors, playing an important role in the formation of the helices of R-1. They are responsible for the twist of the chain aggregates, which is crucial for the formation of the helices.",

      "question": "What role does the un-dissolved ligand of R-pempH2 play in the formation of helices of R-1?",
      "answer": "The un-dissolved ligand of R-pempH2 serves two roles during the helix formation: (1) it acts as a buffer against pH change in the solution during the self-assembly process, and (2) it serves as nucleation centers at which the helices of R-1 grow.",

    {
      "question": "Describe the hierarchical self-assembly route proposed for the formation of helices of R-1.",
      "answer": "The formation of helices of R-1 occurs via a hierarchical self-assembly route that involves twisted packing due to the geometric incompatibility of different types of chains. This process starts with the formation of Tb/R-pemp complexes and fragments of 1D helical chains, which further assemble into hierarchical bundles, leading to the formation of R-1 with a 1D helical morphology.",

      "question": "Explain the significance of the observed chiral transcription from molecules to morphologies in the synthesis of [Tb(R- or S-pempH)3]∙2H2O.",
      "answer": "The observed chiral transcription from molecules to morphologies is significant for understanding bio-related self-assembly processes on the nano- to macro-scale. It demonstrates how chirality at the molecular level can influence and determine the macroscopic structure of the synthesized material.",

      "question": "What experimental techniques were used to characterize the helices of R-1 and S-1?",
      "answer": "The helices of R-1 and S-1 were characterized using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), infrared spectroscopy (IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), thermal analysis (TGA), and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy.",

      "question": "How does the temperature affect the formation of helices in the synthesis of [Tb(R- or S-pempH)3]∙2H2O?",
      "answer": "The formation of helices of R-1 is temperature-dependent. Helices were obtained when the reaction temperature reached 100–140 °C, but the pitches of the helices were significantly different, indicating that a suitable temperature range is crucial for the formation of helices.",

    {
      "question": "True or False: The presence of different cations, such as K+, Ca2+, Sr2+, and Ba2+, has no influence on the formation of helices of R-1.",
      "answer": "False. The presence of different cations can affect the size and morphology of the helices, although generally, the cations had little influence on the formation of the helices. However, the presence of a particular cation did affect the morphology of the helices, such as helices formed in the presence of Ba2+ had smaller helical pitches.",

      "question": "True or False: The helices of R-1 have a high degree of crystallinity and almost the same structure at the molecular level as that of rod-like crystals of R-3.",
      "answer": "True. The PXRD patterns of R-1 and R-3 were similar, indicating that the helices possess long-range intermolecular order and have a similar structure at the molecular level as that of the rod-like crystals of R-3, but at the macroscopic level, they are different from R-3.",

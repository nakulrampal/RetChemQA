    },
    {
      "question": "What was the role of D2O in the enzyme assay for LphTPS-A?",
      "answer": "D2O was used to support a proposed reprotonation step at C5 of prespatane by showing deuterium incorporation into the prespatane skeleton.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"

      "question": "What was the purpose of using Ni-NTA and Benzamidine/Sepharose Agarose beads in the purification of LphTPS-A?",
      "answer": "The Ni-NTA and Benzamidine/Sepharose Agarose beads were used to separate the recombinant LphTPS-A from thrombin and His-tag fragments.",

    {
      "question": "True or False: The phylogenetic analysis revealed that LphTPS-A, LphTPS-B, and LphTPS-C form a well-supported monophyletic clade separate from sesquiterpene synthases from other domains of life.",

      "question": "What was the result of incubating LphTPS-A with geranyl diphosphate (GPP) or geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) in the substrate specificity assays?",
      "answer": "Incubation with GPP or GGPP resulted in no terpene product formation, confirming LphTPS-A as a sesquiterpene synthase specific for 15-carbon substrates.",

    {
      "question": "True or False: The EI-MS fragmentation mechanism of prespatane suggests that deuterium incorporation upon reprotonation from D2O occurs at the blue highlighted ring of prespatane.",

      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "How was the absolute structure of prespatane revised based on the crystalline sponge XRD data?",
      "answer": "The absolute structure of prespatane was revised based on the crystalline sponge XRD data, which showed that the previously reported relative configuration at prespataneâ€™s C8 stereogenic center is opposite to that determined in the study.",

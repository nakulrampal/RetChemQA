      "question": "What is the role of adsorbent flexibility in adsorptive separation?",
      "answer": "The role of adsorbent flexibility for adsorptive separation is controversial. However, the gating action, an unconventional type of flexibility, can be used to achieve molecular sieving.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How do the MOFs 1·DMA and 2·DMA differ in their response to guest removal?",
      "answer": "The host framework of 1·DMA can be retained after complete guest removal, while removal of DMA from 2·DMA results in a guest-free structure with a significantly reduced unit-cell volume.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the gating energy barrier in the context of molecular sieving?",
      "answer": "The gating energy barrier is critical for achieving molecular sieving as it controls the ability of the MOF to selectively adsorb smaller guests while completely excluding larger ones.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The MOF 2′ shows steep type-I isotherms for CO2 adsorption at ambient temperatures, indicating strong host-guest interaction.",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"

    {
      "question": "What experimental techniques were used to monitor the structural transformation of 2′ during gas adsorption?",
      "answer": "In situ PXRD and SCXRD were used to monitor the potential structural transformation of 2′ during gas adsorption.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the MOF 2′ demonstrate molecular sieving for CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 mixtures?",
      "answer": "Quantitative column breakthrough experiments showed that 2′ allows CO2 to adsorb much later than N2 and CH4, demonstrating molecular sieving by excluding N2 and CH4.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the observed effect of temperature on the CO2 adsorption selectivity in the MOF 2′?",
      "answer": "The optimum temperature for CO2 adsorption selectivity in the MOF 2′ should be higher than 195 K and lower than 298 K, as CO2 uptake increases with decreasing temperature within this range.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"

    {
      "question": "True or False: The MOF 2′ is capable of adsorptive separation of C2H4 from C2H6 with a selectivity of 1.9.",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What challenges are associated with determining the sizes of molecules and pores for molecular sieving?",
      "answer": "Precise determination of molecule and pore sizes is challenging due to the quantum effect and the flexible nature of molecules/materials, making size parameters useful but not determinative for molecular sieving.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the MOF 2′ demonstrate the ability to switch adsorption selectivity for C2H4/C2H6?",
      "answer": "Using a 10:10:80 C2H4/C2H6/He mixture, the MOF 2′ demonstrates the ability to switch adsorption selectivity for C2H4/C2H6, showing an exceptional example of inversing adsorption selectivity by changing separation conditions.",

      "question": "What is the significance of using titanocene dichloride in the synthesis of COK-69?",
      "answer": "Titanocene dichloride is used as a hydrolytically more robust organometallic Ti precursor for the formation of porous titanium carboxylates, allowing more precise control over the solvolysis of the metal precursor and leading to the formation of COK-69, a new, breathing titanium(IV) trans-1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylate framework.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does the structure of COK-69 compare to that of MIL-88 in terms of topology and flexibility?",
      "answer": "COK-69 and MIL-88 share the same underlying acs topology featuring trigonal-bipyramidal cages and one-dimensional hexagonal channels. However, COK-69 exhibits a rare breathing behavior due to the conformational flexibility of its cdc2Â¢ linker, unlike the rigid terephthalate linkers in MIL-88.",

    {
      "question": "What experimental evidence supports the presence of TiIII species in photoreduced COK-69?",
      "answer": "The presence of TiIII species in photoreduced COK-69 is supported by EPR spectroscopy, which shows a clear signal with g parameters corresponding to a TiIII species, and by 2H MAS NMR spectroscopy, which indicates the formation of Ti-OD groups upon photoreduction.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What role does the cyclohexanedicarboxylate linker play in the breathing behavior of COK-69?",
      "answer": "The cyclohexanedicarboxylate linker, due to its inherent flexibility, allows the COK-69 framework to exhibit a breathing behavior. This flexibility enables the linker to adopt different conformations (e,e' or a,a'), which in turn leads to structural changes in the framework upon guest removal or adsorption.",

    },
    {
      "question": "Can the porosity of COK-69 be determined directly by gas adsorption?",
      "answer": "No, the porosity of guest-loaded COK-69op cannot be directly determined by gas adsorption due to the contraction of the framework upon evacuation. Instead, the void volume of the framework is estimated using software.",

    {
      "question": "Is the synthesis of COK-69 affected by the atmosphere used during the reaction?",

    {
      "question": "How does the use of microwave irradiation affect the synthesis of COK-69?",
      "answer": "Microwave irradiation allows the synthesis of COK-69 to be scaled up and significantly reduces the synthesis time to about 10 minutes, although a higher quality material is obtained from the solvothermal reaction.",

    {
      "question": "What is the impact of solvent polarity on the breathing behavior of COK-69?",
      "answer": "Solvents of low polarity, such as toluene or tetrahydrofuran, can induce the recovery of the open-pore solid COK-69op, while polar solvents, such as acetonitrile or dimethyl sulfoxide, are incapable of reopening the evacuated material.",

      "question": "What is the significance of the trinuclear [TiIV3(m3-O)(O)2(COO)6] cluster in COK-69?",
      "answer": "The trinuclear [TiIV3(m3-O)(O)2(COO)6] cluster in COK-69 is significant because it is an unprecedented cluster in MOF chemistry, closely resembling motifs based on trivalent cations in well-known MOFs, and opens the road to the synthesis of new structures with titanium.",

      "question": "What is the synthesis procedure for Cu[Ni(pdt)2]?",
      "answer": "The synthesis of Cu[Ni(pdt)2] involves sparging a flask containing 270 mL of acetonitrile with dry N2 for 30 minutes, adding Na2[Ni(pdt)2] (0.630 g, 1.62 mmol) to the solvent, and stirring. In a separate flask, 75 mL of acetonitrile is sparged with dry N2 for 30 minutes, and CuI (0.309 g, 1.62 mmol) is added. The CuI solution is then slowly added to the Na2[Ni(pdt)2] solution under a positive atmosphere of N2, resulting in the rapid precipitation of Cu[Ni(pdt)2] as a black solid. The solid is filtered, activated overnight at 90 °C under high vacuum, yielding a dark red microcrystalline solid.",

      "question": "What are the key findings from the chemiresistive detection study of Cu[Ni(pdt)2]?",
      "answer": "The study found that the conductivity of Cu[Ni(pdt)2] is significantly sensitive to solvation state, with the acetonitrile-solvated material showing 200 times less conductivity than the desolvated material. Cu[Ni(pdt)2] exhibits significant changes in conductivity dependent on hydrocarbon identity, with the change in conductance being independent of binding strength. The sensitivity of conductance in Cu[Ni(pdt)2] to each adsorbate correlates strongly with the gas-phase specific heat capacity of the adsorbate.",

      "question": "How does the conductivity of Cu[Ni(pdt)2] change upon exposure to acetonitrile vapor?",
      "answer": "Upon exposure to acetonitrile vapor, the conductivity of Cu[Ni(pdt)2] decreases to 0.015 μS/cm, which is nearly 200 times lower than the conductivity measured for the desolvated framework.",

      "question": "What role does the gas-phase specific heat capacity play in the chemiresistive response of Cu[Ni(pdt)2]?",
      "answer": "The gas-phase specific heat capacity of the adsorbate strongly correlates with the sensitivity of the conductivity in Cu[Ni(pdt)2] to each adsorbate, suggesting that the ensemble of states available to exchange heat with the host lattice influences the charge hopping process.",

      "answer": "The study used the parallel version of the CRYSTAL17 suite of programs for all calculations, employing the unrestricted PBE0−D3(BJ) hybrid density functional with the pob_TZVP basis-set, and included a very fine DFT grid (XXLGRID) for total energy convergence.",

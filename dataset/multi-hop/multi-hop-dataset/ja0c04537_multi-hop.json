    },
    {
      "question": "What are the crystal systems for compounds 1-L and 1-D?",
      "answer": "Both compounds 1-L and 1-D have a triclinic crystal system.",

      "question": "How were the T1(1H) relaxation times measured for the 1-L and 1-D MOFs?",
      "answer": "The T1(1H) relaxation times for the 1-L and 1-D MOFs were measured by individually fitting the intensity of the 13C NMR signals as a function of the saturation recovery delay.",

      "question": "What is the significance of the T1(1H) / T1(13C) ratio found in an isotopically enriched glycine sample for estimating T1(13C) in non-enriched samples?",
      "answer": "The T1(1H) / T1(13C) ratio found in an isotopically enriched glycine sample is used to estimate T1(13C) in non-enriched samples, assuming that the ratio should be smaller in non-enriched samples due to the absence of large dipolar coupling effects.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What was the purpose of performing Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analysis on the samples?",
      "answer": "The purpose of performing SEM analysis on the samples was to exclude the effect of particle sizes on the nanometric scale and to rule out size-dependency as a potential cause of observed L/D signal differences.",

      "question": "What were the recycle delay values set for the 13C CP-MAS experiments run on 1-L and 1-D samples?",
      "answer": "The recycle delay values for the 13C CP-MAS experiments run on 1-L and 1-D samples were set to 6.5 seconds.",

      "question": "True or False: The crystal structures of compounds 1-L and 1-D contain channels filled with a variable number of lattice water molecules.",

      "question": "What was the result of the pattern-matching analysis of the polycrystalline samples of 1-L and 1-D?",
      "answer": "The pattern-matching analysis confirmed the purity of the polycrystalline samples of 1-L and 1-D.",

    {
      "question": "What does the presence of an intense band around 3600 cm-1 in the FTIR spectra of compounds 1-L and 1-D indicate?",
      "answer": "The presence of an intense band around 3600 cm-1 in the FTIR spectra indicates the vibration of the Oâ€“H bond of water.",

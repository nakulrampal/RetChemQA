      "answer": "A mixture of iron­(III) chloride hexahydrate (FeCl3·6H2O, 3.6 g, 13.3 mmol), nickel­(II) nitrate hexahydrate (Ni­(NO3)2·6H2O, 2.0 g, 6.7 mmol), and 2-aminoterephthalic acid (H2bdc-NH2, 3.6 g, 20 mmol) was dissolved in DMF (200 mL) and sonicated for 20 min. Subsequently, aqueous sodium hydroxide solution (8 mL, 1 M) was dropwise added under stirring. The solution was sonicated for 40 min, transferred into a 500 mL vial sealed with a screw cap, and heated at 100 °C for 12 h. The brown solid was collected by centrifuge, washed by DMF and MeOH several times, and dried in the air at room temperature overnight.",

      "question": "How does the synthesis condition of FeNi-MIL-88B differ from that of Fe-MIL-88B-tpy?",
      "answer": "The synthesis condition of FeNi-MIL-88B involves the use of iron­(III) chloride hexahydrate, nickel­(II) nitrate hexahydrate, and 2-aminoterephthalic acid, heated at 100 °C for 12 h. For Fe-MIL-88B-tpy, the process starts with FeNi-MIL-88B and tpy (2,4,6-tris(4-pyridyl)pyridine), which are transferred into DMF and heated at 190 °C for 14 h. The key differences are the additional use of tpy in the synthesis of Fe-MIL-88B-tpy and the higher heating temperature (190 °C) compared to the synthesis of FeNi-MIL-88B (100 °C).",

      "question": "What are the BET surface areas for capsular-MOF and solid-MOF, and how do they compare?",
      "answer": "The BET surface area for capsular-MOF is 1157 m2/g, and for solid-MOF, it is 1010 m2/g. The capsular-MOF has a higher BET surface area compared to the solid-MOF, indicating a more porous structure that could potentially offer better catalytic properties or gas adsorption capabilities.",

      "question": "What is the significance of the BET surface area in the context of MOFs?",
      "answer": "The BET surface area is a measure of the porosity and surface area available in a material, which is crucial for applications like catalysis, gas storage, and adsorption. In the context of Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs), a higher BET surface area indicates more active sites and larger surface for interactions, making the MOF more effective for its intended application.",

      "question": "What role does tpy play in the synthesis of Fe-MIL-88B-tpy?",
      "answer": "tpy (2,4,6-tris(4-pyridyl)pyridine) acts as an additional ligand in the synthesis of Fe-MIL-88B-tpy, contributing to the formation of a distinct structure compared to FeNi-MIL-88B. It likely influences the framework's porosity, surface area, and potentially its catalytic properties by altering the coordination environment and the overall structure of the MOF.",

      "question": "How does the loading of sulfur and iodine into capsular-MOF compare to solid-MOF?",
      "answer": "The loading of sulfur into capsular-MOF is 2.00 g/g, and for iodine, it is 2.57 g/g. In contrast, solid-MOF has a sulfur loading of 0.72 g/g and iodine loading of 1.38 g/g. This indicates that capsular-MOF has a significantly higher capacity for loading both sulfur and iodine compared to solid-MOF, likely due to its higher porosity and surface area.",

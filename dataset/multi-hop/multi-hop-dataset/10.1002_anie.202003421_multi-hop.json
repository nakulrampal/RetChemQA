      "question": "How does metal substitution affect the performance of GeFSIX-dps-Cu and GeFSIX-dps-Zn in gas separation?",
      "answer": "Metal substitution from Zn to Cu fine-tunes the linker rotation and layer stacking, creating a slightly expanded pore aperture and interlayer space, which facilitates easier entrance of alkyne while excluding alkene.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the threshold pressure in the context of the MOFs' ability to separate alkynes from alkenes?",
      "answer": "The threshold pressure is significant because it determines the pressure at which the MOFs start to adsorb alkynes significantly while still excluding alkenes, with GeFSIX-dps-Cu having a notably advanced threshold pressure for alkynes adsorption.",

    {
      "question": "What role do hydrogen bonds play in the adsorption mechanism of alkynes in GeFSIX-dps-Cu and GeFSIX-dps-Zn?",
      "answer": "Hydrogen bonds facilitate the strong interaction between alkynes and the framework, especially at site II, leading to higher calculated static binding energy and thus contributing to the selective adsorption of alkynes over alkenes.",

      "question": "How does the structural tuning via metal substitution impact both C3H4/C3H6 and C2H2/C2H4 mixtures?",
      "answer": "The structural tuning via metal substitution affects both mixtures similarly, enabling desired alkyne/alkene sieving separation by creating optimal pore aperture and interlayer space for easier alkyne entrance while excluding alkenes.",

    {
      "question": "What is the effect of the smaller metal-N distance in GeFSIX-dps-Cu compared to GeFSIX-dps-Zn?",
      "answer": "The smaller metal-N distance in GeFSIX-dps-Cu results in a stronger bond, which decreases the degrees of freedom for relative change between two phases, affecting the rotation of the pyridine ring and the framework flexibility.",

    {
      "question": "What is the primary challenge in achieving molecular sieving of alkenes from alkynes as mentioned in the text?",
      "answer": "The primary challenge is the close molecular size between alkyne and alkene, making it difficult to achieve not only high capacity for one gas but also complete exclusion for another one.",

    {
      "question": "How does the flexibility of the pyridine ring and layer sliding contribute to the adsorption process in GeFSIX-dps-Cu?",
      "answer": "The flexibility of the pyridine ring and layer sliding make adsorption possible above a threshold pressure, especially in GeFSIX-dps-Cu, by allowing the formation of interconnected channels and voids within the framework for guest molecule accommodation.",

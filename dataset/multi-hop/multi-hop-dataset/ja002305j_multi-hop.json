      "question": "What are the synthesis conditions for the Sm(II) complexes with aryloxide, thiolate, and amide ligands?",
      "answer": "The Sm(II) complexes with aryloxide, thiolate, and amide ligands were synthesized by reacting (C5Me5)2Sm(THF)2 with 1 equiv of KOAr, KSAr, KNHAr, or KN(SiMe3)2 in THF.",

      "question": "Which complex showed the highest selectivity for the block copolymerization of styrene and ethylene?",
      "answer": "The thiolate ligand SC6H2iPr3-2,4,6 (1c) showed the highest selectivity for the block copolymerization of styrene and ethylene.",

    {
      "question": "What is the role of the 'C5Me5M' unit in the polymerization reactions?",
      "answer": "The 'C5Me5M' unit acts as a neutral coordination ligand bonding to the Sm(II) center with the 'C5Me5' part and its dissociation from the Sm(II) center is an essential step in the polymerization reactions.",

    {
      "question": "True or False: The less reducing Yb(II) complex 1f showed activity for the polymerization of ethylene under the same conditions as the Sm(II) complexes.",
      "answer": "False. The less reducing Yb(II) complex 1f did not show an activity for the polymerization of ethylene under the same conditions.",

      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What influences the selectivity and activity of the Sm(II) complexes in polymerization reactions?",
      "answer": "The selectivity and activity of the Sm(II) complexes in polymerization reactions are influenced by the steric and electronic effects of the mixed C5Me5/ER ligands.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The copolymerization reactions always yielded random or alternating styrene−ethylene copolymers.",
      "answer": "False. The copolymerization reactions selectively formed block styrene−ethylene copolymers rather than random or alternating ones.",

      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of block styrene−ethylene copolymers compared to their random or alternating copolymeric analogues?",
      "answer": "Block styrene−ethylene copolymers have uniquely different chemical, physical, and mechanical properties compared to their random or alternating copolymeric analogues, and particularly show great emulsifying or compatibilizing effect in the blending of the corresponding homopolymers.",

      "question": "True or False: The 'C5Me5K' unit prefers to bond to the phosphide ligand with the K atom in complex 1g.",
      "answer": "True. In complex 1g, the 'C5Me5K' unit is bonded to the phosphide site with its K atom.",

    {
      "question": "How does the 'C5Me5M' unit affect the structure of the Ln(II) complexes?",
      "answer": "The 'C5Me5M' unit affects the structure of the Ln(II) complexes by preferring formation of a polymeric structure through intermolecular interactions when ER is an aryloxide, thiolate, or amide ligand, while the 'C5Me5Na'-coordinated complexes adopt a 'monomeric' form due to coordination of more THF ligands to the Na atom.",

    {
      "question": "True or False: The polymerization of styrene by the silylene-linked cyclopentadienyl complex 1h might proceed through an 'anionic' process.",
      "answer": "True. The mechanism of styrene polymerization by 1h was not clear, but it might proceed to some extent through an 'anionic' process.",

      "question": "What are the synthesis conditions for NENU-499?",
      "answer": "A mixture of sodium molybdate dihydrate, Mo powder, H3PO3, zinc chloride, tetrabutylammonium hydroxide solution in water, and H2O was stirred, acidified to pH 4.8 with diluted HCl, and then 6-nitrobenzimidazole was added. The mixture was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel container and heated at 180 °C for 72 hours.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does the synthesis of NENU-500 differ from that of NENU-501?",
      "answer": "The synthesis of NENU-500 and NENU-501 involves similar starting materials and conditions, but NENU-500 uses H3BTB as the organic linker, while NENU-501 uses H3BPT instead.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The synthesis of NENU-499 involves heating the reaction mixture at 180 °C for 72 hours.",
      "answer": "True",

      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does tetrabutylammonium hydroxide play in the synthesis of NENU-499?",
      "answer": "Tetrabutylammonium hydroxide acts as a pH adjuster and possibly as a structure-directing agent in the synthesis of NENU-499.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is the pH adjusted to 4.8 during the synthesis of NENU-499?",
      "answer": "The pH is adjusted to 4.8 to control the reaction conditions, possibly to optimize the formation of the desired product by affecting the solubility of reactants or the stability of intermediates.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: NENU-500 and NENU-501 have the same empirical formula.",
      "answer": "False",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of using different organic linkers in the synthesis of NENU-500 and NENU-501?",
      "answer": "Using different organic linkers, H3BTB for NENU-500 and H3BPT for NENU-501, leads to the formation of metal-organic frameworks with potentially different structural characteristics, porosity, and functional properties.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The synthesis of NENU-500 and NENU-501 requires the use of a Teflon-lined stainless steel container.",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What common feature is shared by the synthesis procedures of NENU-499, NENU-500, and NENU-501?",
      "answer": "All three synthesis procedures involve heating the reaction mixture in a Teflon-lined stainless steel container at 180 °C for a specified duration.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the choice of organic linker affect the properties of the resulting metal-organic frameworks?",
      "answer": "The choice of organic linker affects the connectivity, pore size, and functional groups present in the resulting metal-organic frameworks, which in turn influences their stability, porosity, and potential applications in catalysis, gas storage, or separation.",
      "difficulty": "hard",

    {
      "question": "How does the arrangement of polymeric chains viewed from different crystal faces affect the materials' elasticity?",
      "answer": "The almost identical arrangement of the polymeric chains from the perspective of different pairs of crystal faces indicates that a close structural similarity in two directions perpendicular to the elongation of the crystal is critical for inducing and controlling elasticity.",

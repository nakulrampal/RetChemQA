      "question": "What distinguishes ZnCar·DMF from other peptide-based MOFs?",
      "answer": "ZnCar·DMF is distinguished by its 3D framework where each carnosine molecule links four tetrahedral Zn cations, two of which are bridged by the deprotonated imidazolate ring, and its chemical stability in organic solvents and water.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does the structure of ZnCar change upon resolvation in MeOH and H2O?",
      "answer": "Upon resolvation in MeOH and H2O, ZnCar adapts by changing the torsional conformations of carnosine without breaking the 4:4 connectivity motif between Zn and carnosine, resulting in structures different from the as-made or desolvated material.",

    {
      "question": "What demonstrates the structural flexibility of ZnCar·DMF?",
      "answer": "The structural flexibility of ZnCar·DMF is demonstrated by its ability to adapt its framework to MeOH and H2O guests due to the torsional flexibility of the main His-b-Ala chain, while retaining the rigidity conferred by the Zn–imidazolate chains.",

      "question": "What is the significance of the imidazolate rings in the structure of ZnCar?",
      "answer": "The imidazolate rings and Zn cations form a zigzag chain that is the rigid part of the structure, contributing to the chemical stability and permanent porosity of ZnCar.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does the presence of MeOH and H2O guests affect the torsion angles of carnosine in ZnCar?",
      "answer": "The presence of MeOH and H2O guests affects the torsion angles of carnosine in ZnCar by causing them to change, which leads to different structural conformations and the adaptability of the framework to different guest molecules.",

      "question": "What is the role of H bonds in the adaptability of ZnCar to different guests?",
      "answer": "H bonds play a crucial role in the adaptability of ZnCar to different guests by permitting structural transformations and leading to different torsional conformations of carnosine, which allows the framework to adapt while maintaining its connectivity motif.",

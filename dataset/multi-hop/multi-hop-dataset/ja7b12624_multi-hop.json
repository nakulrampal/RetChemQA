      "question": "What are the synthesis conditions for compound 3?",
      "answer": "Compound 3 was synthesized using a one-pot methodology involving 2-ethylpyrimidine-5-carbaldehyde, 4-acetylpyridine, KOH, and aqueous NH3 in EtOH solution.",

      "question": "How does the substitution of H, Me, or Et on the pyrimidin-5-yl functionality of compounds 1, 2, and 3 affect their assembly on Au(111) surfaces?",
      "answer": "The substitution affects the packing density and assembly motifs on Au(111) surfaces. While 1 and 2 form extended close-packed phases, the larger ethyl substituent in 3 increases the molecule's footprint, leading to a looser 2D assembly with a regular porous vacancy pattern.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The assembly of ladder-like arrays from compounds 1, 2, or 3 with Cu adatoms on Au(111) is influenced by the substituent.",
      "answer": "False. The ladder structure assembles on Au(111) in all cases and exhibits the same backbone structure, indicating the assembly is not influenced by the substituent.",

      "question": "What role do acetate anions play in the assembly of [Cu2(OAc)4(3)]n?",
      "answer": "Acetate anions are critical to the formation of paddle-wheel {Cu2(μ-OAc)4} units which act as linear nodes and direct the assembly of 1D zigzag chains.",

      "question": "How does the presence of methanol solvent influence the assembly of {[Cu­(3)­(OMe)­(MeOH)]­[CF3SO3]·MeOH}n?",
      "answer": "Methanol solvent is involved in the assembly of {Cu2(μ-OMe)2} units which act as planar, 4-connecting nodes connected by ligands 3 to generate a 2D (4,4) net.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What structural transition is observed upon annealing the surface assemblies of compounds 1 and 3 on Cu(111)?",
      "answer": "Upon annealing at elevated temperatures, the original surface assemblies of 1 and 3 are modified and undergo a transition from ladders into rhomboid structures.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The surface assemblies of compounds 1, 2, or 3 on Cu(111) are different from those on Au(111).",
      "answer": "False. The appearance of the same ladder-like assemblies on both Cu(111) and Au(111) surfaces testifies to this being a robust motif, with no significant differences observed.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"

      "question": "What unique surface assembly is formed by compound 2 upon further annealing on Cu(111)?",
      "answer": "Further annealing of the tetramers on Cu(111) with ligand 2 results in a rearrangement into a quasi-hexagonal nanoporous network.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The coordination behavior of pyrimidinyl-functionalized ligands 1–3 with copper in solution is identical to their on-surface interactions with copper adatoms.",
      "answer": "False. The coordination behavior in solution contrasts with on-surface interactions, where solvent and counteranion roles are negated, and different assembly motifs are observed.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the steric demand of the substituents in compounds 1–3 affect the formation of a nanoporous network on Cu(111)?",
      "answer": "The steric demand of the substituents affects the compactness of the packing in the nanoporous network. The most compact packing is obtained with the methyl substituent in compound 2, whereas the ethyl substituent in 3 has too great a steric demand, and compound 1's lack of a substituent destabilizes the arrangement.",

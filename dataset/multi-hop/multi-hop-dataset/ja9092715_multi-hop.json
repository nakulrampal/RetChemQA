      "question": "What is the effect of functionalization on the flexibility and pore opening of MIL-53(Fe) type solids?",
      "answer": "Functionalization of MIL-53(Fe) type solids with various groups (e.g., -Cl, -Br, -CF3, -CH3, -NH2, -OH, -CO2H) affects their flexibility and pore opening by modulating the host-guest interactions and steric hindrance, leading to slightly different breathing characters.",

    {
      "question": "How does the presence of functional groups in MIL-53(Fe) solids influence their adsorption properties for different liquids?",
      "answer": "The presence of functional groups in MIL-53(Fe) solids influences their adsorption properties by affecting the strength of host-guest interactions, which can counterbalance intraframework interactions and lead to selective adsorption of liquids based on the solvent-framework affinity.",

    {
      "question": "What role do intraframework hydrogen bonds play in the stability of the narrow pore form of modified MIL-53(Fe) solids?",
      "answer": "Intraframework hydrogen bonds play a significant role in the stability of the narrow pore form of modified MIL-53(Fe) solids by stabilizing the structure and potentially increasing the energy barrier for transitioning to the large pore form.",

    {
      "question": "Why do MIL-53(Fe)-CH3 and MIL-53(Fe)-(CF3)2 not easily open in the presence of selected solvents despite their lower energy difference between narrow and large pore forms?",
      "answer": "MIL-53(Fe)-CH3 and MIL-53(Fe)-(CF3)2 do not easily open in the presence of selected solvents because their functional groups only weakly interact with guests through van der Waals interactions, leading to a low energy gain through host-guest interaction.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the dehydration process affect the cell volumes of modified MIL-53(Fe) solids?",
      "answer": "The dehydration process affects the cell volumes of modified MIL-53(Fe) solids by causing negligible increases or decreases in cell volumes, suggesting that the volume of the guest (water) does not play a significant role in unit cell volume variations.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the angle between the pore axis and the phenyl ring in the structure of modified MIL-53(Fe) solids?",
      "answer": "The angle between the pore axis and the phenyl ring in the structure of modified MIL-53(Fe) solids is significant as it indicates the rotation of the phenyl rings, which is influenced by the presence of functional groups and affects the structure's flexibility and pore opening.",

    {
      "question": "How does the synthesis method of modified MIL-53(Fe) solids impact their structural and adsorption properties?",
      "answer": "The synthesis method of modified MIL-53(Fe) solids, including the choice of reactants and conditions (e.g., use of hydrofluoric acid), impacts their structural properties by determining the type and distribution of functional groups, which in turn influences their adsorption properties and flexibility.",

    {
      "question": "Can the flexibility and adsorption properties of MIL-53(Fe) solids be tailored by functionalization for specific applications?",
      "answer": "Yes, the flexibility and adsorption properties of MIL-53(Fe) solids can be tailored by functionalization with specific groups for targeted applications, as the functional groups affect host-guest interactions, pore opening, and the stability of different structural forms.",
      "difficulty": "hard",

    {
      "question": "Is the presence of intraframework hydrogen bonds more stabilizing for the narrow pore form of MIL-53(Fe)-(CO2H)2 compared to other modified MIL-53(Fe) solids?",
      "answer": "Yes, the presence of intraframework hydrogen bonds is more stabilizing for the narrow pore form of MIL-53(Fe)-(CO2H)2 compared to other modified MIL-53(Fe) solids, as evidenced by its reluctance to transition to the large pore form upon adsorption of various solvents.",
      "difficulty": "hard",

    },
    {
      "question": "Does the modification of MIL-53(Fe) solids with different functional groups offer a potential pathway for designing materials with selective adsorption capabilities?",
      "answer": "Yes, the modification of MIL-53(Fe) solids with different functional groups offers a potential pathway for designing materials with selective adsorption capabilities, as the functional groups can be chosen to optimize interactions with specific guests, leading to selective adsorption.",

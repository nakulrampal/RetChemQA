    {
      "question": "What is the role of increasing the size of the amine templates in the synthesis of compounds 1 to 4?",
      "answer": "Increasing the size of the amine templates gradually increases the inter-layer distance and makes the inter-layer contacts more anisotropic, which eventually leads to the spontaneous rolling up and formation of a tubular structure.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the synthesis approach of compound 4 differ from that of compounds 1 to 3 in terms of structural outcome?",
      "answer": "While compounds 1 to 3 result in 2D lamellar structures, the synthesis approach for compound 4, using a larger amine template (Et3N), leads to the formation of a 1D tubular structure.",

      "question": "Why were the sulfamide groups in compound 3 difficult to refine, and how was this issue addressed?",
      "answer": "The sulfamide groups in compound 3 showed a high degree of thermal motion, making them difficult to refine. This issue was addressed by refining them anisotropically with rigid-bond restraints applied to the thermal parameters.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"

    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the 'SQUEEZE' method used in the refinement of compound 4?",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "Given the synthesis conditions, why might compound 4 exhibit a tubular structure instead of a lamellar one?",
      "answer": "Compound 4 exhibits a tubular structure due to the use of a larger amine template (Et3N), which increases the inter-layer spacing and anisotropy in inter-layer contacts, leading to a spontaneous rolling-up process to form the tubular structure.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does the change in amine template size from Me3N to Et3N influence the structural transformation from lamellar to tubular in the synthesized compounds?",
      "answer": "The change in amine template size from Me3N to Et3N increases the inter-layer distance and anisotropy in inter-layer contacts, which facilitates the structural transformation from lamellar to tubular by enabling the rolling-up process.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is the 'SQUEEZE' method necessary for the crystal structure analysis of compound 4?",
      "answer": "The 'SQUEEZE' method is necessary for the crystal structure analysis of compound 4 to account for disordered triethylammonium cations and lattice methanol, which cannot be modeled directly due to their disorder.",

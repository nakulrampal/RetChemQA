      "question": "What is the concept of 'retrosynthesis' introduced in MOF chemistry, and how does it differ from traditional one-pot synthesis methods?",
      "answer": "The concept of 'retrosynthesis' introduced in MOF chemistry involves breaking down a proposed MOF structure into available organic linkers and metal clusters (synthons), and then sequentially assembling them under kinetic guidance. This approach differs from traditional one-pot synthesis methods by allowing for the stepwise construction of complex MOFs with multiple components in a predictable manner, avoiding the formation of undesired thermodynamically favored products.",

      "question": "What are the three criteria for selecting a parent MOF for the incorporation of secondary linkers and metal clusters?",
      "answer": "The three criteria for selecting a parent MOF are: 1) existence of binding sites for the installation of hetero-linkers or clusters, 2) large enough cavities to provide sufficient space for the subsequent incorporation of metalâ€“organic moieties, and 3) high stability to ensure the structural intactness during multiple modification reactions.",

      "question": "How does the incorporation of different metals and linkers in PCN-201(Ni)-Cu and PCN-202(Ni)-Hf affect their structure and properties compared to their parent MOF, PCN-224?",
      "answer": "The incorporation of different metals and linkers in PCN-201(Ni)-Cu and PCN-202(Ni)-Hf leads to the formation of quaternary MOFs with complex structures that are compartmentalized in a predetermined array within the crystal lattice. This results in a change in the pore environment and gas adsorption properties, with a decrease in N2 total uptake and pore diameter compared to their parent MOF, PCN-224. Additionally, the new structures exhibit high stability in aqueous solutions with varying pH levels.",

      "question": "What is the significance of the cooperative bimetallic catalytic system constructed in PCN-201(Fe)-Cu for Strecker reactions?",
      "answer": "The cooperative bimetallic catalytic system constructed in PCN-201(Fe)-Cu is significant because it integrates high valence FeIII and low valence CuI centers, which simultaneously activate the electrophiles and nucleophiles. This leads to improved catalytic activity toward three-component, one-pot Strecker reactions, demonstrating a cooperative effect of two catalytically active sites in a solid-state material for enhanced reaction kinetics and selectivity.",

      "question": "What challenges are associated with the synthesis of multi-component MOFs and how does the stepwise synthesis approach address these challenges?",
      "answer": "The challenges associated with the synthesis of multi-component MOFs include the lack of control during framework assembly in one-pot reactions, leading to the formation of thermodynamically favored products and excluding labile components. The stepwise synthesis approach addresses these challenges by allowing for the sequential installation of linkers and formation of metal clusters under kinetic guidance, thus enabling the construction of complex MOFs with multiple components in a predictable manner.",

    {
      "question": "How does the retrosynthesis approach in MOF chemistry mimic the concept used in organic synthesis?",
      "answer": "The retrosynthesis approach in MOF chemistry mimics the concept used in organic synthesis by conceptually breaking down a proposed MOF structure into simpler precursors (organic linkers and metal clusters) and then sequentially assembling them under kinetic guidance. This parallels the retrosynthetic analysis in organic synthesis, where complex organic molecules are constructed by transforming a target molecule into simpler precursors and applying known chemical reactions to assemble them together.",

    {
      "question": "What role does kinetic analysis play in the retrosynthesis of multi-component MOFs?",
      "answer": "Kinetic analysis plays a crucial role in the retrosynthesis of multi-component MOFs by guiding the sequential assembly of organic linkers and metal clusters under controlled conditions. It ensures that different components can be precisely placed at designated positions within the crystal lattice while maintaining the structural integrity of the MOF backbone, thus enabling the isolation of complex MOFs as kinetic products and avoiding undesired thermodynamic products.",

      "answer": "The advantages of incorporating cooperative bimetallic catalytic systems in MOFs for chemical reactions include enhanced catalytic activity, improved reaction kinetics, and higher selectivity due to the simultaneous activation of both nucleophilic and electrophilic reactants. Additionally, coupling two catalytic sites in a MOF offers easy catalyst separation and recovery, regeneration, and handling, making it a convenient and efficient approach for catalysis in a solid-state material.",

      "answer": "Experimental evidence supporting the single crystal to single-crystal transformation process in the synthesis of PCN-201 and PCN-202 includes the unambiguous demonstration of stepwise incorporation of organic linkers and formation of metal clusters through single-crystal X-ray diffraction, microscopic observation of crystals during modification showing no change in size or shape, and analysis of the solution and digested MOF samples by UV and ICP-MS, which eliminated the possibility of MOF dissolution and recrystallization.",

Opportunities exist in the intrinsic designability of MOFs and the evolving synthetic methodologies, suggesting that achieving a high degree of control in constructing complex MOFs with multiple functionalities and applications is eventually achievable.",

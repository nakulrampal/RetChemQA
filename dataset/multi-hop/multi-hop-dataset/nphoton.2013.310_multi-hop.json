      "question": "What is the phenomenon that allows the magnet to switch the polarization plane of light by 90 degrees under optical stimulation?",
      "answer": "The magnet can switch the polarization plane of light by 90 degrees under optical stimulation due to light-reversible spin-crossover on the iron(II) ion, which causes alternate optical switching between crystallographic and magnetic contributions to second-harmonic generation within the magnet.",

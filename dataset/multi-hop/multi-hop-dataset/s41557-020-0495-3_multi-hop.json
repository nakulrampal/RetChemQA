      "question": "What is the primary focus of the study conducted by Jacopo Perego and colleagues?",
      "answer": "The primary focus of the study conducted by Jacopo Perego and colleagues is to demonstrate fast molecular rotor dynamics within the struts of a zinc-based metal–organic framework at very low temperatures.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the symmetry mismatch in the zinc-based MOF contribute to the rotor dynamics?",
      "answer": "The symmetry mismatch in the zinc-based MOF, where the three-fold trigonal symmetry of the rotator conflicts with the four-fold symmetry of the struts, frustrates the formation of stable conformations, allowing for continuous, unidirectional, hyperfast rotation of the bicyclic units.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the energy barrier for rotation in the zinc-based MOF lower than the thermal energy at liquid helium temperature?",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does the pivotal σ bond play in the dynamics of the molecular rotors within the MOFs?",
      "answer": "The pivotal σ bond between the sp3 carbons of the bicyclic unit and the carboxylate moieties provides high torsional flexibility, which is crucial for the fast rotation of the molecular rotors within the MOFs.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does replacing zinc with zirconium affect the rotation of the bicyclic units in the MOF?",
      "answer": "Replacing zinc with zirconium leads to a different metal cluster–carboxylate coordination arrangement in the resulting metal–organic framework, resulting in much slower rotation of the bicyclic units.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Does the study provide evidence of fast molecular rotors operating at temperatures as low as 2 K?",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What experimental technique was used to characterize the fast motion of molecular rotors in the study?",
      "answer": "1H NMR spin–lattice relaxation times (1H T1) were recorded to characterize the fast motion of molecular rotors in the study.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the porosity of the MOFs contribute to the dynamics of the molecular rotors?",
      "answer": "The porosity of the MOFs, with large free volumes, promotes disentangled rotator revolution and minimizes rotor–rotor and rotor–framework interactions, thereby facilitating the dynamics of the molecular rotors.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the rotation frequency of the molecular rotors in the zinc-based MOF in the gigahertz regime even at very low temperatures?",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What computational methods were used to gain insight into the rotary mechanism of the molecular rotors?",
      "answer": "Molecular dynamics simulations were used to gain insight into the rotary mechanism and identify durable runs of hyperfast unidirectional continuous rotation of the molecular rotors.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"

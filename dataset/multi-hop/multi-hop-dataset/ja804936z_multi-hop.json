      "question": "What is the synthesis condition for Ni-STA-12 as described in the experimental section?",
      "answer": "In a typical preparation, 0.209 g of nickel acetate and 0.157 g of the N,Nâ€²-piperazinebismethylenehosphonic acid were dissolved in 15 mL of H2O, and the solution was placed in a Teflon-lined Parr autoclave and heated in an oven for 3 days at 493 K. The resulting green solid was filtered and dried.",

    {
      "question": "How does the structure of Ni-STA-12 change upon dehydration and rehydration according to the results and discussion section?",
      "answer": "The structure of Ni-STA-12 changes from hydrated with physisorbed and chemisorbed water molecules in the pores and coordinated to nickel cations, to a fully dehydrated triclinic phase upon heating above 373 K. This dehydration process involves the loss of water molecules and a structural rearrangement where the nickel coordination changes from NiO5N octahedra to NiO4N polyhedra. This process is reversible upon rehydration.",

      "question": "True or False: The adsorption of CO2 on fully dehydrated Ni-STA-12 at 304 K results in a higher uptake compared to methane at the same conditions.",

      "question": "What are the distinct adsorption sites identified in dehydrated Ni-STA-12 for adsorbate molecules?",
      "answer": "In dehydrated Ni-STA-12, the distinct adsorption sites include coordinatively unsaturated nickel cation sites in three different environments, P=O groups on one in three phosphonates, as well as sites on the organic linkers.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does the adsorption enthalpy of CO2 change with increasing coverage on fully dehydrated Ni-STA-12 at 304 K?",
      "answer": "The adsorption enthalpy of CO2 on fully dehydrated Ni-STA-12 at 304 K starts at 30-35 kJ mol-1 for initial adsorption values, reaches a maximum at 4 mmol g-1, and then decreases, indicating a two-step adsorption process with different energy regimes.",

      "question": "True or False: The interaction of hydrogen with Ni-STA-12 at 77 K is stronger than with carbon monoxide at the same temperature.",

      "question": "What spectroscopic method was used to investigate the nature of adsorption sites in Ni-STA-12 for the probe molecules H2 and CO?",
      "answer": "Infrared (IR) spectroscopy was used to investigate the nature of adsorption sites in Ni-STA-12 for the probe molecules H2 and CO.",

    {
      "question": "Describe the effect of water vapor pressure on the IR spectra of dehydrated Ni-STA-12.",
      "answer": "Exposure to water vapor pressure on dehydrated Ni-STA-12 results in the formation of a broad band centered at 3300 cm-1 due to hydrogen-bonded water, removal of the component centered at 2750 cm-1, growth of a band at 1650 cm-1, and erosion of the band at 1500 cm-1, indicating the presence of bound water molecules and the formation of a hydrogen-bonded network.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What changes occur in the IR spectrum of Ni-STA-12 upon sequential adsorption of methanol?",
      "answer": "Upon sequential adsorption of methanol on Ni-STA-12, the IR spectrum shows the formation of a broad band centered at 2750 cm-1 due to strongly hydrogen-bonded hydroxyl groups, changes in the C-H stretching region, disappearance of the band at 1206 cm-1 attributed to the P=O bond, and formation of bands associated with less strongly perturbed OH groups and methoxy groups bound to Ni sites.",

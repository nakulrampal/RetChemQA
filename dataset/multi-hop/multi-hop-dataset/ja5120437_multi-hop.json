      "question": "What is the role of cadmium(II) centers in the metal-organic receptor discussed in the text?",
      "answer": "The flexible coordination spheres of cadmium(II) centers allow the receptor to dynamically adjust its structure upon exchanging four triflate or triflimide counterions for two oxocarbon anions, resulting in strong cooperativity and very tight binding.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the substitution of cadmium(II) ions with copper(I) affect the metal-organic receptor?",
      "answer": "Substituting the cadmium(II) ions for copper(I) by switching solvent prompts a structural reorganization and release of the oxocarbon anions.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What triggers the release of oxocarbon anions from the metal-organic receptor?",
      "answer": "The release of oxocarbon anions is triggered by switching the solvent, which prompts a structural reorganization by substituting cadmium(II) ions for copper(I).",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the apparent association constant for C5O52– as mentioned in the text, and what does it indicate about the receptor's binding affinity?",
      "answer": "The apparent association constant for C5O52– is 5 × 10^10 M^–1, indicating that the receptor has a very tight binding affinity for oxocarbon anions.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "Based on the synthesis conditions described, what is the role of subcomponent A in the formation of the metal-organic receptor?",
      "answer": "Subcomponent A, based on a pseudo-four-fold symmetric (cyclopentadienyl)(cyclobutadienyl) cobalt (CpCoCb) moiety, reacts with 2-formylpyridines to generate a tetrakis(bidentate) ligand, which is crucial for forming the symmetrical sandwich structure of the metal-organic receptor.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the cooperative behavior of the metal-organic receptor compare to hemoglobin's oxygen transport efficiency?",
      "answer": "The cooperative behavior of the metal-organic receptor enables it to deliver 1.6 times as much anion as it would if the sites were independent, a value comparable to the cooperative advantage enjoyed by hemoglobin in transporting oxygen.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the receptor's ability to undergo a solvent-dependent metal exchange between Cd(II) and Cu(I)?",
      "answer": "The receptor's ability to undergo a solvent-dependent metal exchange between Cd(II) and Cu(I) is significant because it allows for a cycle of loading and release of anions by solvent-mediated interconversion, which is crucial for applications like high-value extractions.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The metal-organic receptor can selectively and cooperatively load and release oxocarbon anions.",

      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The receptor's cooperative behavior is limited to the binding of oxocarbon anions and does not extend to other anions like PF6–, BF4–, Br–, or I–.",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The receptor's structure remains static upon binding with oxocarbon anions.",
      "answer": "False",
      "difficulty": "easy",

    {
      "question": "True or False: The receptor's cooperative binding behavior is less efficient than hemoglobin's oxygen transport.",

    {
      "question": "True or False: The receptor's ability to catch and release anions at low concentrations is not beneficial for applications like chemical sensors or drug delivery systems.",

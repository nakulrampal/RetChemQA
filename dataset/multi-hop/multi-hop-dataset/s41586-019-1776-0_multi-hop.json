      "question": "What are the two methods developed for the incorporation of metal(II) halide clusters in Zr6O4(OH)4(bpydc)6?",
      "answer": "The first method involved reacting ~50 µm single crystals of 1 with an excess (> 50 equiv) of metal halide source in either neat diglyme or 10% DME in DFB, giving the highest crystallographic MX2 loadings. The second method involved reacting microcrystalline (~0.2–5 µm crystallites) powder samples of 1 with stoichiometric amounts of metal halide source, including a few single crystals for structural characterization by single-crystal X-ray diffraction.",

    {
      "question": "What techniques were used to characterize the microcrystalline powder samples of 1 after reaction with metal halide sources?",
      "answer": "The microcrystalline powder samples were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, gas adsorption measurements, inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), Mössbauer spectroscopy, and magnetic measurements.",

    {
      "question": "How does the framework surface area change with different MX2 (NiBr2 or NiCl2) loadings?",
      "answer": "The framework surface area significantly reduces after metal(II) halide incorporation due to the metal halide clusters filling a large portion of the framework pores. However, the surface area increases upon lowering the MX2 loading, suggesting that the clusters in partially-loaded frameworks remain accessible for further interaction with guest molecules.",

      "question": "What was the effect of temperature on the quadrupole splittings (DEQ) of the four pseudooctahedral iron(II) sites in 1(FeCl2)19?",
      "answer": "The quadrupole splittings (DEQ) of the four pseudooctahedral iron(II) sites in 1(FeCl2)19 decrease with a small non-linearity from 5 to 295 K, and their temperature dependence may be fit with the Ingalls’ model to obtain the low-symmetry component of the octahedral crystal field.",

    {
      "question": "What was observed in the Mössbauer spectra of 1(FeCl2)19 between 5 and 295 K?",
      "answer": "The Mössbauer spectra of 1(FeCl2)19 between 5 and 295 K showed iron(II) quadrupole doublets, consistent with the crystallographic environments in 1(FeCl2)17, indicating that 1(FeCl2)19 behaves as a paramagnet at these temperatures. Upon cooling from 8 to 5 K, a broadening was observed along with the appearance of a superparamagnetic sextet.",

    {
      "question": "How does the synthesis condition affect the formation of metal(II) halide sheets within the framework?",
      "answer": "The synthesis condition, specifically the concentration of coordinating solvent, affects the equilibrium between the clusters and dissolved metal species, driving the formation of metal(II) halide sheets. Lowering the concentration of coordinating solvent strongly promotes sheet formation, as seen in the reactions with CoCl2 and FeCl2 in a 10% (v/v) solvent mixture of DME and DFB.",

    {
      "question": "What magnetic behaviors were observed for the isolated metal(II) halide sheets compared to their bulk counterparts?",
      "answer": "The isolated metal(II) halide sheets exhibited magnetic behaviours distinct from those of the bulk metal halides, including the isolation of ferromagnetically coupled large-spin ground states through the elimination of long-range, interlayer magnetic ordering.",

      "question": "True or False: The Debye temperature obtained from fitting the temperature dependence of the logarithm of the spectral absorption area of 1(FeCl2)19 indicates the relative hardness of the layered encapsulated lattice.",

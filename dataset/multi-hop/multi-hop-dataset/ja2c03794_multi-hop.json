      "question": "What are the key features observed in the thermogravimetric analysis of [Cu(BTDAT)(MeOH)]?",
      "answer": "The thermogravimetric analysis reveals a gradual mass loss up to 255 °C, likely due to the liberation of the coordinated solvent, and a more substantial mass loss above ca. 350 °C due to ligand decomposition.",

    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) band observed in the Vis/NIR SEC of [Cu(BTDAT)(MeOH)]?",
      "answer": "The IVCT band, attributed to charge-transfer within pseudo-1D stacks of mixed-valence BTDAT ligands, suggests the presence of mixed-valence species in the framework and indicates strong electron delocalization.",

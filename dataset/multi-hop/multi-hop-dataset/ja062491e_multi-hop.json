      "question": "What is the composition of the metal-organic polyhedra (MOP-18) mentioned in the text?",
      "answer": "MOP-18 is composed of 12 rigid square-shaped Cu2(CO2)4 paddle-wheel building units and 24 5-dodecoxybenzene-1,3-dicarboxylate links.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What solvents was MOP-18 found to be highly soluble in?",
      "answer": "MOP-18 was found to be highly soluble in chloroform, toluene, tetrahydrofuran, ethyl acetate, N,N-dimethylacetamide, and hot DMF.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What was the purpose of the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) performed on MOP-18?",
      "answer": "The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed to observe the weight loss due to the coordinating ligands and guest molecules, and to analyze the decomposition of the organic links in the MOP-18 framework.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What was the observed weight loss percentage from the TGA of MOP-18 up to 280 °C, and what does it indicate?",
      "answer": "The observed weight loss was 25%, indicating the loss of coordinating ligands and guest molecules which include 12 DMF, 4 octanol, and 8 H2O molecules.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What was the method used to deposit MOP-18 on a graphite substrate for STM imaging?",
      "answer": "MOP-18 was dissolved in 1-phenyloctane and placed on freshly cleaved HOPG. The drop was allowed to evaporate over 5 days before STM imaging.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What challenges were encountered during STM imaging of MOP-18?",
      "answer": "Challenges during STM imaging of MOP-18 included no ordered self-assembly observed when attempted at shorter times due to high mobility of MOPs, and inability to image at longer times as the tip could not penetrate the thin film sufficiently.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The thermogravimetric analysis of MOP-18 showed a weight loss of 60% from 280 to 420 °C due to the decomposition of the organic links.",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: MOP-18 is insoluble in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), acetonitrile, methanol, 1-butanol (BuOH), and isoamyl alcohol.",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What was the significance of the line profiles obtained from STM images of MOP-18?",
      "answer": "The line profiles of STM images showed the measured height variation, indicating the packing and mobility of MOP-18 on the surface, although the magnitude of height difference between MOPs is underestimated due to the packing and the quasi-constant height mode in which the images were collected.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The geometry optimization of MOP-18's structure was performed to find a reasonable structural model of the ambiguous coordinating ligands.",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"

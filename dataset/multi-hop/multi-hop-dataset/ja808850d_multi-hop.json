      "question": "Are the sodium ions in complex 1 and complex 2 coordinated in the same manner?",

      "question": "Is the crystal structure of complex 3 more stable than that of complex 1?",
      "answer": "False, the addition of NiCl2 to form complex 3 results in a severe reorganization of the molecules and a reduction in the crystallinity of the solid, suggesting a less stable structure compared to complex 1.",

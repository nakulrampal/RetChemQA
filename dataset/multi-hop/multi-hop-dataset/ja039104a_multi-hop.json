    {
      "question": "What are the synthesis conditions for compound 1?",
      "answer": "An aqueous solution containing manganese(II) perchlorate hexahydrate and sodium azide was added with continuous stirring into the methanol solution of L1 over a period of 15 min. Slow evaporation of the resulting red orange solution at room temperature yielded orange crystals of 1 within 3 days.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the use of L1 and L2 ligands affect the synthesis outcomes?",
      "answer": "The use of L1 and L2 induces spontaneous resolution, yielding conglomerates of chiral compounds [Mn3(L1)2(N3)6]n (1) and [Mn2(L2)2(N3)3]n(ClO4)n·nH2O (2), respectively.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the compound [Mn2(L4)(N3)4]n (4) chiral or achiral?",
      "answer": "Achiral",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What magnetic behavior does compound 1 exhibit?",
      "answer": "Compound 1 behaves as a metamagnet built of homometallic ferrimagnetic chains with a unique “fused-triangles” topology.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does the azido ion play in the synthesis of these coordination polymers?",
      "answer": "The azido ion can bridge metal ions in various modes, dependent on the coligand used, and may mediate antiferro- or ferromagnetic interactions of different magnitudes, dependent on the bridging mode and structural parameters.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Does compound 2 exhibit ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic interactions?",
      "answer": "Antiferromagnetic interactions",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of spontaneous resolution in the synthesis of these compounds?",
      "answer": "Spontaneous resolution upon crystallization without any enantiopure chiral auxiliary yields a conglomerate, which is a mechanical and racemic mixture of chiral crystals, of which each crystal is enantiopure.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the presence of amino and methyl substituents in the ligands affect the properties of the synthesized compounds?",
      "answer": "The presence of amino and methyl substituents in the ligands affects the formation of intermolecular interactions, such as hydrogen bonding, which in turn influences the chirality transmission and the overall structure of the synthesized compounds.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the compound [Mn2(L3)(N3)4]n·nMeOH (3b) chiral?",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What challenges are faced in the crystal engineering of chiral coordination polymers?",
      "answer": "The challenges include predicting the final polymeric architectures due to the coordinative flexibility and diversity of the ligands and the complexity of the intermolecular interactions involved.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"

      "question": "What is the role of accumulated lattice strain in the spontaneous pathway selection during multicomponent crystallization?",
      "answer": "Accumulated lattice strain serves as an internal trigger for pathway selection in multicomponent crystallization, enabling the spontaneous transition from a kinetically preferred layered crystal to a thermodynamically preferred pillared-layer crystal.",

    {
      "question": "How does the synthesis condition of PLCryst differ from that of LCryst?",
      "answer": "The synthesis of PLCryst involves heating a mixture of Zn(NO3)2•6H2O, AzoPy, and 2HPor at 65 °C for 24 hours, while LCryst is synthesized by heating the same mixture but for only 3 hours, leading to the formation of red-colored square LCryst.",

      "question": "What experimental techniques were used to monitor the spontaneous LCryst-to-PLCryst transition?",
      "answer": "The spontaneous LCryst-to-PLCryst transition was monitored using optical microscopy, electronic absorption spectroscopy, 1H NMR spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction.",

      "question": "What triggers the liberation of the square-shaped core region in LCryst during the LCryst-to-PLCryst transition?",
      "answer": "The liberation of the square-shaped core region in LCryst is triggered by the need to relieve the internally accumulated lattice strain around the screw dislocation, which becomes too large for LCryst to sustain without structural deterioration.",

      "question": "What evidence supports the 2D nucleation and growth mechanism for PLCryst?",
      "answer": "Evidence for the 2D nucleation and growth mechanism for PLCryst includes the observation of the Berg effect, characteristic 2D growth units, hoppers on the surface of PLCryst, and AFM analysis showing these features.",

    {
      "question": "How does the strain energy in LCryst depend on the crystal size?",
      "answer": "The total strain energy in LCryst is largely dependent on the crystal size, with a given shear modulus and the magnitude of the Burgers vector, indicating that the strain energy increases with the crystal size.",

    {
      "question": "What role does trifluoroacetic acid play in the study of LCryst?",
      "answer": "Trifluoroacetic acid is used to etch LCryst, preferentially at the geometric center where the screw dislocation is located, demonstrating the active site and supporting the presence of a screw dislocation.",

      "question": "How does the incorporation of AzoPy into the crystalline lattice of LCryst contribute to the formation of PLCryst?",
      "answer": "The incorporation of AzoPy into the crystalline lattice of LCryst contributes to the formation of PLCryst by bridging the constituent ZnPor 2D layers, transforming the structure into a pillared-layer crystal, which is a thermodynamically preferred configuration.",

      "question": "What is the effect of temperature on the growth kinetics of LCryst?",
      "answer": "The growth kinetics of LCryst are temperature-dependent, as demonstrated by the Arrhenius plot showing that the activation energy for LCryst growth is estimated to be 27.7 kJ mol-1, indicating that higher temperatures can accelerate the growth process.",

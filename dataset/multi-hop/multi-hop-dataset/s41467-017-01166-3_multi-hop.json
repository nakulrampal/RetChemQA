      "answer": "Trigonal, R -3 :H",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What temperature and pressure conditions were used for CO2 adsorption measurements in the study?",
      "answer": "Measurements were performed at temperatures of 195, 273, 283, 288, 291, 293, 298, and 308 K and pressures up to 1 bar.",

    {
      "question": "How does the CO2 uptake of FJI-H14 at 298 K and 1 atm compare to that of Mg-MOF-74?",
      "answer": "FJI-H14 has a CO2 uptake of 171 cm3 cm-3 at 298 K and 1 atm, which is lower than Mg-MOF-74's uptake of 176 cm3 g-1.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What method was used to calculate the isosteric heat of adsorption (Qst) for FJI-H14?",
      "answer": "The isosteric heat of adsorption (Qst) was calculated using both the Clausiusâ€“Clapeyron equation and the Virial fitting method.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is FJI-H14 stable in boiling water and acid/base environments?",
      "answer": "Yes, FJI-H14 is very stable in boiling water and in both acid and base environments at pH = 2 to pH = 12 and at temperatures as high as 373 K.",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },

      "question": "What is the role of open metal sites (OMS) and Lewis basic sites (LBS) in FJI-H14 for CO2 capture?",
      "answer": "OMS and LBS in FJI-H14 synergistically capture CO2 molecules in the pores, improving the adsorption capacity more effectively than a single OMS or LBS.",
      "difficulty": "hard",

      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What makes FJI-H14 an ideal and practical adsorbent for post-combustion CO2 capture?",
      "answer": "FJI-H14's high CO2 uptake and selectivity at ambient pressure, excellent chemical and thermal stability, good reusability, and the ability for large-scale production with low cost make it ideal for post-combustion CO2 capture.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does FJI-H14 catalyze the conversion of CO2 into cyclic carbonates using simulated post-combustion flue gas?",
      "answer": "FJI-H14 catalyzes the conversion of CO2 into cyclic carbonates with high efficiency when using a mixed gas containing 0.15 atm CO2 and 0.85 atm N2 to simulate flue gas, showing higher catalytic activity compared to other catalysts.",
      "difficulty": "hard",

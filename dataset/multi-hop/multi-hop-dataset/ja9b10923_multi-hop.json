    {
      "question": "How does JNU-2 achieve selectivity in separating C2H6 from C2H4?",
      "answer": "JNU-2 achieves selectivity in separating C2H6 from C2H4 through its tailored apertures and cage-like cavities, which preferentially interact with C2H6 over C2H4.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What property of JNU-2 allows it to be regenerated at room temperature?",
      "answer": "JNU-2 can be easily regenerated at room temperature due to its moderate adsorption enthalpy.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the kinetic diameter in the context of JNU-2's gas separation capabilities?",
      "answer": "The kinetic diameter is significant because it determines which gas molecules can be selectively adsorbed or sieved by JNU-2 based on the size of its apertures and internal cavities.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: JNU-2's performance in gas separation is unaffected by its exposure to water or different pH solutions.",

    {
      "question": "What role do the electronegative nitrogen and oxygen atoms play in JNU-2's interaction with light hydrocarbons?",
      "answer": "The electronegative nitrogen and oxygen atoms in JNU-2's apertures facilitate stronger interaction with light hydrocarbons, such as C2H6 and C2H4, through electrostatic interactions including C–H···X hydrogen bonding.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The adsorption of both C2H6 and C2H4 in JNU-2 is completely reversible, indicating no oligomerization of C2H4 blocking the channels.",

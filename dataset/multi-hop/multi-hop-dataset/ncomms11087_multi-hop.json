    {
      "question": "What is the primary goal of the research conducted by Huajun He and colleagues, as described in the article?",
      "answer": "The primary goal of the research was to achieve polarized three-photon-pumped (3PP) microcavity laser in a single host–guest composite metal–organic framework (MOF) crystal via a controllable in situ self-assembly strategy.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the orientation of dye molecules within the MOF affect the 3PP lasing?",
      "answer": "The highly oriented assembly of dye molecules within the MOF enables 3PP lasing with a low lasing threshold and a very high-quality factor on excitation, and results in perfectly polarized 3PP lasing.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The research demonstrates that the 3PP lasing generated from composite MOF is not polarized.",
      "answer": "False",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What synthesis strategy was employed to incorporate dye molecules into the MOF crystals?",
      "answer": "An in situ self-assembly strategy was employed, where the components for building a MOF crystal (metal ion and organic linker) and the organic dye molecule are simultaneously assembled together to form the MOF/dye single crystals.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the potential applications of the polarized 3PP microcavity laser in single MOF microcrystal?",
      "answer": "The potential applications include optoelectronic and biomedical applications, particularly in vivo imaging, due to the ability of the polarized 3PP laser to offer stronger spatial confinement, deeper tissue penetration, and less Rayleigh scattering.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The synthesis of ZJU-68 involves the use of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, H2CPQC, DMF, MeCN, H2O, and HBF3 at 100 °C.",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What was the result of incorporating the dye DMASM into the MOF ZJU-68?",
      "answer": "The incorporation of the dye DMASM into the MOF ZJU-68 resulted in the color change from the original colorless ZJU-68 to red ZJU-68*DMASM, indicating successful dye incorporation.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the pore size of ZJU-68 compare to the size of the dye molecule DMASM?",
      "answer": "The pore sizes within ZJU-68 are tuned to match the size of the dye molecule better, but initially, the dye molecules could not diffuse into the pore channels through simple post-synthetic exchange process due to size compatibility issues.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The research found that increasing the dye content in the reaction solution always results in better crystalline ZJU-68*DMASM.",
      "answer": "False",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What challenges does the research address in achieving high-order multiphoton-pumped polarized lasers?",
      "answer": "The research addresses challenges such as minimizing aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ), optimizing the orientation and concentration of dye molecules within the MOF, and achieving suitable microcavity structures for high optical gain and controllable, directional laser generation.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"

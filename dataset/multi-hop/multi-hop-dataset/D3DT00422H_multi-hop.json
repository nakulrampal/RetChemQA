    {
      "question": "What are the names of the two novel alkaline earth metal-based MOFs discussed in the text?",
      "answer": "UoC-9(Ca) and UoC-9(Sr)",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What unique property is enabled by the fluorinated derivative of the BTB-linker in the synthesis of UoC-9(Ca) and UoC-9(Sr)?",
      "answer": "The fluorinated derivative of the BTB-linker enables a unique topology, crystalline sponge behaviour, and a low temperature induced phase transition in the synthesis of UoC-9(Ca) and UoC-9(Sr).",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do UoC-9(Ca) and UoC-9(Sr) not show significant N2 gas uptake after activation attempts?",
      "answer": "UoC-9(Ca) and UoC-9(Sr) do not show significant N2 gas uptake after activation attempts because the crystal structure of UoC-9 collapses upon heating in vacuum or activation with supercritical CO2, leading to the loss of guest molecules from its pores.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens to UoC-9(Ca) and UoC-9(Sr) upon the loss of DMF molecules?",
      "answer": "Upon the loss of DMF molecules, UoC-9(Ca) and UoC-9(Sr) amorphize but can regain crystallinity when exposed to DMF again.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it true or false that the fluorine atoms of the inner phenyl ring of the 3F-BTB linker are directly involved in interactions with DMF guest molecules in UoC-9(Ca) and UoC-9(Sr)?",
      "answer": "False. The fluorine atoms of the inner phenyl ring of the 3F-BTB linker are not involved in any direct interaction with DMF guest molecules in UoC-9(Ca) and UoC-9(Sr).",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What type of interaction is observed between DMF molecules and the 3F-BTB linkers in UoC-9(Ca) and UoC-9(Sr)?",
      "answer": "An amide-π-stacking interaction is observed between DMF molecules and the 3F-BTB linkers in UoC-9(Ca) and UoC-9(Sr), where DMF molecules are sandwiched between the inner phenyl rings of two 3F-BTB linkers.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What does the phase transition from Ima2 to Pna21 in UoC-9(Ca) and UoC-9(Sr) upon cooling indicate about the nature of the transition?",
      "answer": "The phase transition from Ima2 to Pna21 in UoC-9(Ca) and UoC-9(Sr) upon cooling indicates that it is a 2nd order phase transition according to Landau, which is a continuous transition showing no discontinuity of the unit cell volume at the transition temperature.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The synthesis of UoC-9(Ca) and UoC-9(Sr) demonstrates the significant role of direct fluorine contacts to guest molecules in the interactions within fluorinated MOFs.",
      "answer": "False. The synthesis of UoC-9(Ca) and UoC-9(Sr) reveals that secondary effects of fluorine substituents, such as their inductive influence on π-systems, play a greater role in host–guest interactions than simple R–F⋯guest contacts.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What experimental technique was used to confirm the amorphization and recrystallization behavior of UoC-9(Ca) upon loss and exposure to DMF?",
      "answer": "Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) was used to confirm the amorphization and recrystallization behavior of UoC-9(Ca) upon loss and exposure to DMF.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The study of UoC-9(Ca) and UoC-9(Sr) provides conclusive evidence for the permanent porosity of these MOFs.",
      "answer": "False. Although the crystal structure analysis reveals large pores within both MOFs, the recording of N2 sorption isotherms did not lead to a significant gas uptake, indicating that the MOFs may not have permanent porosity as initially suggested.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"

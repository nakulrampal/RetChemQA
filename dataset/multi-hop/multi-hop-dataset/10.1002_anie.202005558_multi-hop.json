      "question": "What is the role of 1,10-phenanthroline in the synthesis of STA-28?",
      "answer": "1,10-phenanthroline acts as a framework-bound template that binds to Al3+ cations at a specific site in the zeotype framework, expanding the coordination of a crystallographically-distinct framework Al from tetrahedral AlO4 to octahedral AlO4N2.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the substitution of iron into the STA-28 framework affect its catalytic activity?",
      "answer": "Iron substitution into AlPOs, including STA-28, imparts catalytic activity, as demonstrated by the catalytic activity observed in AlPO-5 when substituted with iron cations.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What method confirms the selective substitution of Fe atoms at a specific site in the STA-28 framework?",
      "answer": "ADF-STEM imaging confirms the selective substitution of Fe atoms at a specific site in the STA-28 framework, as it shows differences in relative intensities between AlPO and FeAlPO, indicating Fe is located preferentially in the Al(5) site.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens to the STA-28 framework upon calcination and how does it affect the material's porosity?",
      "answer": "Upon calcination, the STA-28 framework retains its structure but experiences some loss of crystallinity and porosity, as indicated by a decrease in pore volume from the predicted value for the ideal structure to the measured value after calcination.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is STA-28 considered less stable compared to other AlPO4 structures, and how does 1,10-phenanthroline influence its crystallization?",
      "answer": "STA-28 is considered less stable than other AlPO4 structures due to the higher energy resulting from the distorted tetrahedral environment around Al(5) when 1,10-phen is removed. The crystallization of STA-28 is facilitated by 1,10-phen, which provides extra stabilization by expanding the coordination of Al from tetrahedral to octahedral.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the Fe/(Al + Fe) ratio in the synthesis of STA-28(Fe) materials?",
      "answer": "The Fe/(Al + Fe) ratio in the synthesis of STA-28(Fe) materials determines the extent of iron substitution in the framework. Single phase STA-28(Fe) materials with Fe/(Al + Fe) ratios up to 0.155 were formed, indicating successful iron substitution without forming a second crystalline phase up to this ratio.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does the presence of methyl groups in substituted 1,10-phenanthrolines affect the synthesis of STA-28?",
      "answer": "The presence of methyl groups in substituted 1,10-phenanthrolines affects the synthesis of STA-28 by either preventing coordination due to steric hindrance or allowing the framework to adapt and accommodate both the phenanthroline group and the substituting methyl groups, depending on the position of the methyl groups.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can the substitution of Fe for Al in the STA-28 framework be achieved using sources of iron other than iron (II) acetate?",
      "answer": "Yes, the substitution of Fe for Al in the STA-28 framework can also be achieved using FeCl3 as the iron source, indicating flexibility in the choice of iron sources for the synthesis.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role do the 12-ring openings play in the structure of STA-28?",
      "answer": "The 12-ring openings in the structure of STA-28 facilitate three-dimensional connectivity of the pore space, allowing for intersecting channels that enhance the material's porosity and potential for catalytic activity.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the use of 1,10-phen and its methylated analogues as templates influence the unit cell size of STA-28?",
      "answer": "The use of 1,10-phen and its methylated analogues as templates influences the unit cell size of STA-28 by causing the unit cell to expand as the framework adapts to accommodate the template molecules, with or without substituting methyl groups.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the effect of calcination temperature on the integrity of the STA-28 framework?",
      "answer": "Calcination above 600°C removes the template from the STA-28 framework, but calcination at 600°C for 10 hours results in some loss of crystallinity, indicating that the calcination temperature must be carefully controlled to preserve the framework's integrity.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the coordination environment of Fe in STA-28(Fe) compare to that in other Fe-bearing solids?",
      "answer": "The coordination environment of Fe in STA-28(Fe), mainly as Fe3+ in an octahedral environment, is consistent with Fe being in the framework and suggests oxidation of FeII during synthesis. This is similar to Fe3+ coordination environments observed in other Fe-bearing solids.",

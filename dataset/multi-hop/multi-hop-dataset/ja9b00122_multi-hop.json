      "question": "What is the significance of the synthesis conditions mentioned in the text for the development of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)?",
      "answer": "The synthesis conditions mentioned are crucial for the development of MOFs as they dictate the formation of various topologies, control the steric hindrance, and influence the resulting MOF structures' porosity, stability, and functional properties.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the introduction of different substituents (e.g., -CH3, -Cl, -OCH3) affect the properties and applications of the synthesized MOFs?",
      "answer": "The introduction of different substituents affects the steric hindrance, which in turn influences the MOFs' topologies, pore environments, and functional properties. This allows for the tuning of the MOFs for specific applications such as gas adsorption, separation, and catalysis.",

    {
      "question": "What role does the linker configuration play in the formation of MOFs with different topologies?",
      "answer": "The linker configuration, influenced by the presence of various substituents, plays a critical role in the formation of MOFs with different topologies by dictating the rotation of peripheral phenyl rings and the overall structure of the MOF, leading to the discovery of MOFs with unique properties.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can the thermal stability of MOFs be determined by their connectivity number?",
      "answer": "Yes, the thermal stability of MOFs can be influenced by their connectivity number, as MOFs with higher connectivity numbers tend to show higher thermal stability due to stronger bonding and more robust structures.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the gas adsorption capacity of MOFs vary with different functionalized linkers?",
      "answer": "The gas adsorption capacity of MOFs varies with different functionalized linkers due to changes in pore size, volume, and surface area, which are influenced by the steric effects of the functional groups, leading to MOFs optimized for specific gas adsorption applications.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the impact of mixed-linker strategies on the formation of MOFs with unique topologies?",
      "answer": "Mixed-linker strategies impact the formation of MOFs with unique topologies by allowing for continuous tunability of steric hindrances, leading to the rearrangement of metal clusters and the discovery of MOFs with novel structures and enhanced functionalities.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The synthesis of MOFs with different topologies solely depends on the type of metal used.",
      "answer": "False. While the type of metal is important, the synthesis of MOFs with different topologies also depends on the linker configuration, the presence of substituents, and the synthesis conditions.",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: All MOFs demonstrate high chemical stability in various solvents.",
      "answer": "False. The chemical stability of MOFs in various solvents varies depending on their structure, connectivity number, and the nature of the functional groups present in the linkers.",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The introduction of bulky substituents always leads to an increase in the pore volume of MOFs.",
      "answer": "False. While bulky substituents can influence the pore environment, their impact on pore volume is not always straightforward and depends on the overall structure and topology of the MOF.",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The gas adsorption properties of MOFs can be precisely controlled by adjusting the ratio of mixed linkers.",
      "answer": "True. Adjusting the ratio of mixed linkers allows for the fine-tuning of the MOFs' pore environments and steric hindrances, leading to MOFs with optimized gas adsorption properties for specific applications.",

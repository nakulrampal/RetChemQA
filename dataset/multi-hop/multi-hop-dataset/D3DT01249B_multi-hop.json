      "question": "What are the key features of anionic N-heterocyclic carbenes featuring weakly coordinating perfluoroalkylphosphorane moieties?",
      "answer": "The key features include their negative charge, large buried volume (%Vbur), enhanced σ-donor and π-acceptor abilities compared to neutral NHCs, the presence of weakly coordinating groups, and their high thermal stability.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How do the electronic properties of the anionic N-heterocyclic carbenes compare to those of neutral NHCs?",
      "answer": "The anionic N-heterocyclic carbenes have enhanced σ-donor and π-acceptor abilities compared to neutral NHCs, as indicated by DFT calculations and their ability to form stable complexes with metal centers.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does the (C2F5)3PF2 Lewis acid play in the properties of the anionic N-heterocyclic carbenes?",
      "answer": "The (C2F5)3PF2 Lewis acid contributes to the unique properties of the anionic N-heterocyclic carbenes by providing weakly coordinating groups, enhancing their thermal stability, and influencing their electronic properties such as σ-donor and π-acceptor abilities.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the buried volume (%Vbur) in the context of anionic N-heterocyclic carbenes?",
      "answer": "The buried volume (%Vbur) is significant as it indicates the steric demand of the anionic N-heterocyclic carbenes. A large %Vbur suggests that these carbenes are bulky and can cover almost the full hemisphere around a metal atom, affecting their ability to act as ligands in coordination chemistry.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the presence of weakly coordinating groups in anionic N-heterocyclic carbenes affect their application in coordination chemistry?",
      "answer": "The presence of weakly coordinating groups in anionic N-heterocyclic carbenes makes them promising ligands in coordination chemistry by allowing for the stabilization of reactive species, facilitating the activation of strong bonds, and contributing to the synthesis of highly active transition metal catalysts.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The anionic N-heterocyclic carbenes are less thermally stable than their neutral counterparts.",
      "answer": "False. The anionic N-heterocyclic carbenes are reported to have unprecedented stabilities compared to related species, which is attributed to the stabilization by the strong Lewis acid (C2F5)3PF2.",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The σ/π-separation of the anionic N-heterocyclic carbenes is larger than that of neutral NHCs.",
      "answer": "False. The σ/π-separation of the anionic N-heterocyclic carbenes is smaller than that of neutral NHCs, indicating that they are stronger π-acceptors with enhanced σ-donor abilities.",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What challenges were encountered in the synthesis of the selenium adduct of the dianionic N-heterocyclic carbene 4?",
      "answer": "The synthesis of the selenium adduct of the dianionic N-heterocyclic carbene 4 was unsuccessful despite several attempts, likely due to the high steric shielding provided by the two (C2F5)3PF2 groups surrounding the carbene center, which prevented the reaction.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How do the steric and electronic properties of anionic N-heterocyclic carbenes influence their reactivity with metal centers?",
      "answer": "The steric and electronic properties, such as large buried volume and enhanced σ-donor and π-acceptor abilities, enable anionic N-heterocyclic carbenes to form stable complexes with metal centers despite their bulky nature, influencing their reactivity and making them suitable ligands for catalysis and coordination chemistry.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The orientation of the C2F5 groups in the anionic N-heterocyclic carbene complexes is consistent across all structures.",
      "answer": "False. The orientation of the C2F5 groups in the anionic N-heterocyclic carbene complexes varies, demonstrating the flexibility of the steric environment of the phosphoranes, which can influence the properties and reactivity of the complexes.",

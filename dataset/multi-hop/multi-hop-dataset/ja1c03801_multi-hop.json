      "question": "What are the synthesis conditions for FTR-P1 and FTR-P1d?",
      "answer": "FTR-P1 and FTR-P1d were synthesized by dispersing bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanedicarboxylic acid, 4,4’-bipyridine (or 4,4’-bipyridine-d8 for FTR-P1d), and Zn(NO3)2·6H2O in a DMF and MeOH mixture, sonicated for 1 minute, and then heated at 85°C in a preheated oven for 24 hours. After cooling to room temperature, the crystals were filtered, washed with a 3:2 mixture of MeOH/DMF and then with fresh MeOH, dried in air, and activated under vacuum at 140°C for 8 hours.",

      "question": "How does the presence of CO2 affect the dynamics of molecular rotors in FTR-P1d?",
      "answer": "The presence of CO2 in FTR-P1d dramatically changes the global rotation mechanism of the molecular rotors. At room temperature, the full-turn rotation of ring A (facing the channels) is suppressed, and only jumps of ±39.5° are preserved, demonstrating restricted dynamics. The activation energy for the rotational frequencies of bipyridine rings increases to 5.2-5.3 kcal/mol due to the protrusion of the rings temporarily into the channels, now occupied by CO2 molecules. This represents a penalty paid by the rotators A of 3.5 kcal/mol compared to the empty sample.",

    {
      "question": "What is the effect of temperature on the phase transition of FTR-P1d under vacuum?",
      "answer": "The phase transition of FTR-P1d under vacuum from the β-phase to the α-phase is temperature-dependent. As the temperature decreases from 390 K to 210 K, the fraction of the α-phase increases, reaching a maximum at 210 K. Upon reheating, the fraction of the α-phase decreases, indicating a reversible phase transition. This transition is associated with the systematic appearance and disappearance of specific PXRD peaks, indicative of the α-phase, as the temperature changes.",

      "question": "What are the key structural features of FTR-P1 and FTR-P1d?",
      "answer": "FTR-P1 and FTR-P1d feature a reticular system with a dinuclear zinc node and two different linkers: a 4,4’-bipyridine and a bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid (BCP). The architecture comprises two interpenetrated networks that extend in a plane via the bridging bis-carboxylic groups of BCP and expand perpendicularly through the 4,4’-bipy-zinc interaction. The crystal packing shows the presence of columnar cavities running parallel to columns aligned with the bipyridine linker.",

    {
      "question": "How does the phase composition of FTR-P1d change with CO2 pressure at 298 K?",
      "answer": "The phase composition of FTR-P1d changes with CO2 pressure at 298 K, showing an increase in the fraction of the α'-phase as the CO2 pressure increases from 0 to 2 bar. The CO2 occupancy also increases with pressure, indicating a correlation between CO2 adsorption and the increase in the α'-phase fraction. This suggests that CO2 adsorption promotes the transition to or stabilization of the α'-phase.",

      "question": "True or False: The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of FTR-P1 and FTR-P1d shows a sharp weight loss at 330°C, indicating the degradation of the bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane moiety.",

      "question": "What is the role of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) in the analysis of FTR-P1 and FTR-P1d?",
      "answer": "Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) is used to analyze the thermal properties of FTR-P1 and FTR-P1d, including the detection of phase transitions and the degradation of the bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane moiety. DSC traces show an exothermic event at 332°C and 342°C for FTR-P1d, indicating the degradation of the bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane moiety. DSC also reveals a phase transition around 220 K, associated with a change in the dynamics of the molecular rotors.",

      "question": "What is the significance of the isosteric heat of adsorption in the context of CO2 adsorption in FTR-P1 and FTR-P1d?",
      "answer": "The isosteric heat of adsorption is a critical parameter that quantifies the interaction energy between CO2 molecules and the adsorbent material, in this case, FTR-P1 and FTR-P1d. It provides insights into the strength of CO2 binding and the efficiency of the material for CO2 capture. The isosteric heat values, calculated through Langmuir and Langmuir-Freundlich models and measured via sorption-coupled microcalorimetry, indicate strong CO2 adsorption, with values around 32.5 kJ/mol for FTR-P1 and slightly varying for FTR-P1d, suggesting effective CO2 capture capabilities.",

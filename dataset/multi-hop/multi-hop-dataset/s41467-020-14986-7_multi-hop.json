      "question": "What is the primary goal of integrating viologen-based 2D semiconductors?",
      "answer": "The primary goal is to achieve single-component semiconductors with intrinsic UV–SWIR photoresponse, photo/thermo activeness, and very long lifetime of radical products.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the cyanide-bridged layer-directed intercalation approach contribute to the development of viologen-based 2D semiconductors?",
      "answer": "This approach enables the orderly and infinite accumulation of axial ligands, facilitating the construction of a semiconductor with infinitely stacked organic supramolecular layers, which is beneficial for achieving broad photoresponse and efficient charge separation.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The photoresponsive range of the as-prepared crystalline sample of 1 is in the range of 280–420 nm.",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the key factors that improve the stability of viologen radicals in the synthesized semiconductors?",
      "answer": "The stability of viologen radicals is improved by sandwiching the radicals between cyanide-bridged layers, which helps to shield the radicals from air and avoid contact with oxygen.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What method was used to measure the photocurrent response in the synthesized viologen-based 2D semiconductors?",
      "answer": "The photocurrent response was measured using a two-probe method with pellet samples by applying silver paste, and lasers with different wavelengths were used for photocurrent tests.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of achieving a photoresponsive range that covers the entire UV–SWIR region in viologen-based 2D semiconductors?",
      "answer": "Achieving a photoresponsive range that covers the entire UV–SWIR region is significant because it reduces the complexity and cost of photodetectors, promotes power conversion efficiency of solar cells, and sets a record for single-component organic-based semiconductors.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The cyanide-bridged layer-directed intercalation approach has been previously demonstrated for achieving single-component semiconductors with intrinsic UV–SWIR photoresponse.",

    {
      "question": "What challenges are addressed by the cyanide-bridged layer-directed intercalation approach in the synthesis of viologen-based 2D semiconductors?",
      "answer": "The approach addresses challenges such as low photoconversion rate in bulk media, instability of radical products, and the need for semiconductors with broad photoresponse and efficient charge separation.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"

    {
      "question": "What future improvements are planned for the synthesized viologen-based 2D semiconductors?",
      "answer": "Future improvements include enhancing electrical properties such as conductivity and photocurrent gain, extending the photoresponse bands to the mid-IR region, and exploring effective methods to construct optical devices.",

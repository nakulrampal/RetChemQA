      "question": "What are the synthesis conditions for NU-700?",
      "answer": "10 mg ZrCl4 and 10 mg L1 were added into 1 mL N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) in a 1.5-dram vial. The solution was sonicated for 5 minutes. Then, 400 μL of formic acid (HCOOH) was added to the solution and shaken for a few seconds. The vial was placed into a 120 ℃ oven for 2 days. Colorless hexagonal thin crystals were collected with 65% yield based on L1.",

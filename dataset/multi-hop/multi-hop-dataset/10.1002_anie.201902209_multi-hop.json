    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the C3H6/C3H8 adsorption enthalpy difference in MAF-23-O?",
      "answer": "The significant difference in C3H6/C3H8 adsorption enthalpy in MAF-23-O, with C3H6 having much higher adsorption enthalpy than C3H8, indicates a strong preference for C3H6 adsorption, contributing to the high selectivity.",

    {
      "question": "Why is the IAST selectivity for MAF-23-O lower than the experimental selectivity obtained from breakthrough experiments?",
      "answer": "IAST selectivity for MAF-23-O is lower due to its many requirements and potential errors arising from narrow pores, framework flexibility, and large binding difference, which may not accurately reflect experimental conditions.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does framework flexibility play in the adsorption process of MAF-23-O?",
      "answer": "Framework flexibility, especially kinetically controlled flexibility, is necessary for C3H6/C3H8 adsorption in MAF-23-O, allowing transient structural transformations for the diffusion of large guests.",

      "question": "How does the presence of carbonyl groups in MAF-23-O affect the adsorption of C3H6 and C3H8?",
      "answer": "The carbonyl groups in MAF-23-O enhance C3H6 adsorption by forming hydrogen bonds with C3H6's C(sp2)@H bond, while reducing C3H8 adsorption due to the reduced Lewis basicity of the N atoms and lack of specific interactions.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What indicates the strong interaction between the LaIII in La-BTTc and the carbonyl oxygen atom of acetone?",
      "answer": "The largest low-frequency shift of ca. 30 cm–1 in the IR spectrum of acetone-adsorbed La-BTTc indicates the strong interaction.",

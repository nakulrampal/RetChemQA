    },
    {
      "question": "Why is N,N’-dimethylpiperazine not lithiated by tBuLi?",

    {
      "question": "Why does the coordination polymer [(tBuLi)2·(N,N’-dimethylpiperazine)]1 (6) not undergo deprotonation in solution?",
      "answer": "Because the N,N’-dimethylpiperazine molecules in the coordination polymer are orientated at right angles to one another, creating a structure that does not facilitate deprotonation.",

      "answer": "The formation of a-lithiated (R,R)-TMCDA from monomeric tBuLi·(R,R)-TMCDA is facilitated by the spatial proximity of reacting groups, unlike the direct deprotonation of amines which usually requires intramolecular activation.",

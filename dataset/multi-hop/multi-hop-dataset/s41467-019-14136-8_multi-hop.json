      "question": "What is the main advantage of the MOF-directed M-E strategy over the traditional E-M strategy in the synthesis of 2D materials?",
      "answer": "The MOF-directed M-E strategy allows for the preparation of OMCs with much wider adjustable band gap range and homogeneous compositions and properties at nanoscale, compared to the traditional E-M strategy.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the electron-donating ability of organic functional groups and the electronegativity of metals affect the band gap and conductivity of OMCs?",
      "answer": "The band gap of OMCs can be modulated by changing the electron-donating ability of the organic functional groups and the electronegativity of the metals. By decreasing the band gap, the electrical conductivity of OMCs increases over 9 orders of magnitude.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"

    {
      "question": "True or False: The MOF-directed M-E strategy has been previously used for the synthesis of all known 2D materials.",
      "answer": "False",

      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What structural feature of OMCs contributes to their wide band gap modulation and homogeneous properties?",
      "answer": "OMCs possess a unique structure where an inorganic metal chalcogenides layer is fully covered by periodically arranged organic functional groups, contributing to their wide band gap modulation and homogeneous properties.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the conductivity of OMCs change with the band gap, and what is the range of conductivity modulation achieved?",
      "answer": "The conductivity of OMCs increases as the band gap decreases, and the conductivity modulation achieved spans over 9 orders of magnitude.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"

    {
      "question": "True or False: The band gap and conductivity of OMCs cannot be tuned by changing the components of the materials.",

    {
      "question": "What is the role of the electron-donating functional groups on the benzene ring in the conductivity of OMCs?",
      "answer": "The electron-donating functional groups on the benzene ring act similarly to a gating voltage, creating an electric dipole that induces additional holes from electrodes to inject into OMCs, thereby increasing their conductivity.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"

    {
      "question": "True or False: The thickness of OMCs has a significant impact on their band gaps and electronic properties.",

    {
      "question": "What experimental techniques were used to confirm the successful preparation and structural features of OMCs?",
      "answer": "Techniques such as FTIR, XPS, PXRD, elemental analysis, AFM, TEM, and UVâ€“vis spectrophotometry were used to confirm the successful preparation and structural features of OMCs.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"

    {
      "question": "True or False: The MOF-directed M-E strategy results in OMCs that have disordered and partially covered surfaces with organic functional groups.",
      "answer": "False",

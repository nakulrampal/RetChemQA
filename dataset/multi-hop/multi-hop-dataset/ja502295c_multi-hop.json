      "question": "What is the general synthesis procedure for tetra-(dithiocarbamato)-25,26,27,28-tetrapropoxycalix[4]arene ligands K4Ln (n = 1–3)?",
      "answer": "KOH (1 mmol) and CS2 (1 mmol) were added to a solution of respective tetra-amino calix[4]arene (0.25 mmol) in CH3OH (2 mL). The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 4 h, after which a yellow precipitate started to form. The yellow solid was filtered off, washed with diethyl ether (10 mL) and dried under vacuum. The light yellow products were used for further experiments without any purification.",

      "question": "What is the effect of adding Ag+ ions to the luminescence of complex 2 in CH2Cl2-CH3CN solution?",
      "answer": "Upon addition of Ag+ ions to complex 2 in CH2Cl2-CH3CN solution, there is a significant red shift in the emission from 561 nm to 663 nm upon excitation at 430 nm, indicating the formation of AuI···AgI metallophilic interactions and a change in the luminescence properties.",

      "question": "Is the luminescence sensing process of complex 2 for Ag+ ions reversible, and how is it demonstrated?",
      "answer": "Yes, the luminescence sensing process of complex 2 for Ag+ ions is reversible. This is demonstrated by the recovery of green luminescence and the precipitation of AgI upon the addition of an excess of tetraethylammonium iodide (TEAI), indicating the reversibility of the luminescence sensing process.",

      "answer": "The presence of various metal ions, such as Zn2+, Cd2+, Hg2+, Fe3+, Ni2+, Co2+, Pb2+, and Mn2+, does not significantly affect the luminescence of complex 1 when excited at 430 nm. However, the addition of Ag+ ions leads to a significant change, demonstrating the selective luminescence sensing capability of complex 1 for Ag+ ions.",

      "answer": "Under an argon atmosphere at 0 °C, butyllithium (1.25 mL, 1.6 M, 2 mmol) in hexane was slowly added to a solution (0 °C) of 2-bis(2-methoxyethyl)aminomethyl-3-trimethylsilyl-1-propene (0.52 g, 2 mmol) in 10 mL of hexane. The mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and then stirred for 1 h. The volume of the reaction mixture was reduced to 5 mL under vacuum.

      "question": "What are the key features of JXNU-11(Fe2M) MOFs that contribute to their high performance in C2H2/CO2 separation?",
      "answer": "The key features of JXNU-11(Fe2M) MOFs that contribute to their high performance in C2H2/CO2 separation include their unique cage-in-cage structures, the presence of highly electronegative fluorine and carboxylate oxygen atoms on the pore surfaces, and the optimized pore spaces for trapping C2H2.",

      "question": "How do the synthesis conditions of JXNU-11(Fe2M) MOFs differ for Fe2Ni and Fe2Co variants?",
      "answer": "The synthesis conditions for JXNU-11(Fe2M) MOFs differ in the metal source used; FeCl3·6H2O and Ni(NO3)3·6H2O are used for the Fe2Ni variant, while FeCl3·6H2O and Co(NO3)3·6H2O are used for the Fe2Co variant. The rest of the synthesis conditions, including the use of 3,3ʹ,5,5ʹ-tetrakis(fluoro)biphenyl-4,4ʹ-dicarboxylate acid, 1,3,5-tris(4-carboxyphenyl)benzene, DMF, and CH3COOH, as well as the heating process, are the same for both variants.",

    {
      "question": "How does the presence of fluorine and carboxylate oxygen atoms on the pore surfaces of JXNU-11(Fe2M) MOFs affect their gas adsorption behavior?",
      "answer": "The presence of fluorine and carboxylate oxygen atoms on the pore surfaces of JXNU-11(Fe2M) MOFs creates highly electronegative and polarized environments that have a high affinity for the acidic hydrogen atoms of C2H2 molecules but a low affinity for CO2 molecules, leading to selective adsorption behavior.",

    {
      "question": "What role do the cage-in-cage structures play in the performance of JXNU-11(Fe2M) MOFs for C2H2/CO2 separation?",
      "answer": "The cage-in-cage structures in JXNU-11(Fe2M) MOFs provide optimized pore spaces for preferentially trapping C2H2 molecules due to their polarized and fluorophilic character, leading to efficient C2H2/CO2 separation.",

    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the breakthrough times and captured amounts for C2H2 in the performance evaluation of JXNU-11(Fe2M) MOFs?",
      "answer": "The breakthrough times and captured amounts for C2H2 are significant performance indicators for JXNU-11(Fe2M) MOFs, as longer breakthrough times and higher captured amounts indicate a higher efficiency in separating C2H2 from CO2 and a greater capacity for C2H2 storage under dynamic conditions.",

    {
      "question": "True or False: The JXNU-11(Fe2M) MOFs show a higher adsorption selectivity for CO2 over C2H2.",

      "question": "How do the JXNU-11(Fe2M) MOFs compare to other MOFs in terms of C2H2/CO2 separation performance?",
      "answer": "The JXNU-11(Fe2M) MOFs outperform many other MOFs in terms of C2H2/CO2 separation performance, exhibiting record-high C2H2-capture amounts and long C2H2 breakthrough times at ambient conditions, making them among the best materials for this application.",

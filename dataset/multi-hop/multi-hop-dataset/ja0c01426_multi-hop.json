          "answer": "Methyl propiolate was used to react with the linker-bound amine in MOFs, aiming to obtain a high density of short π-systems confined in MOF pores, which resulted in longer wavelength absorption and photosensitization of Yb3+ NIR emission.",

          "answer": "The 'ship-in-a-bottle' synthetic approach addressed the challenges of achieving low energy sensitization of Ln3+-based MOFs without the need for large pores to accommodate large molecular dyes or highly delocalized organic linkers, by preparing a high density of delocalized species in MOF nanopores.",

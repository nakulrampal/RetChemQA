      "question": "What is the primary focus of the research article?",
      "answer": "The primary focus of the research article is on modulating liquid-liquid transitions and glass formation in zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) by decorating them with electron-withdrawing cyano groups.",

    {
      "question": "What synthesis methods were used for the ZIF derivatives in the study?",
      "answer": "The study used solvothermal synthesis for ZIF-4-CNx and attempted it for ZIF-4-dCNx, which did not yield crystals. Mechanochemical synthesis was successfully used for ZIF-4, ZIF-4-CNx, and ZIF-4-dCNx derivatives.",

      "type": "Factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How were the ZIF samples activated after synthesis?",
      "answer": "After synthesis, the ZIF samples were activated by washing with DMF and dichloromethane (DCM), immersion in fresh DCM, and then drying at 175 °C under dynamic vacuum for 3 hours.",

    {
      "question": "What was the role of DFT calculations in the study?",
      "answer": "DFT calculations were used to compare the binding strength of imidazolate-based linkers in ZIFs, specifically looking at the binding energy of a single imidazolate-based linker to a bare Zn2+ ion.",

    {
      "question": "What was observed from the thermal analysis of ZIF-4-CN0.04-solv?",
      "answer": "The thermal analysis of ZIF-4-CN0.04-solv showed that it started to amorphize/melt at about 208 °C, followed by recrystallization to a phase with zni topology starting at about 309 °C, and then melting again between 542 °C and 551 °C.",

      "type": "Factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How was the calorimetric fragility index determined for the ZIF glasses?",
      "answer": "The calorimetric fragility index for the ZIF glasses was determined by cycling melt-quenched ZIF glasses from 50 °C to the end of their glass transition range with varying heating and cooling rates, and then calculating the slope of the plot of log10(1/qc) versus Tg/Tf.",

      "type": "Factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What was the significance of CO2 gas sorption experiments in the study?",
      "answer": "CO2 gas sorption experiments were significant for quantifying the micropore volume in both crystalline and glass phases of ZIFs, providing insights into the porosity and structural changes upon heating and glass formation.",

      "type": "Factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "Based on the study, how does the presence of CN-groups affect the thermal behavior of ZIFs?",
      "answer": "The presence of CN-groups in ZIFs, as seen in ZIF-4-CN0.04-solv, affects the thermal behavior by facilitating low-temperature melting and glass formation, as well as influencing the transition temperatures and enthalpy changes during the framework collapse and liquid-liquid transition.",

    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The study successfully synthesized ZIF-4-dCNx derivatives using solvothermal synthesis.",
      "answer": "False. The study did not successfully synthesize ZIF-4-dCNx derivatives using solvothermal synthesis; instead, it achieved success with mechanochemical synthesis.",
      "difficulty_level": "Easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What potential applications of ZIF glasses were hinted at in the study?",
      "answer": "The study hinted at potential applications of ZIF glasses in areas requiring permanent accessible porosity, such as gas separation, solid-state anhydrous proton batteries, and possibly in optics and opto-electronic devices.",

      "question": "Which metal–organic frameworks were evaluated for the separation of xylene isomers?",
      "answer": "The metal–organic frameworks Co2(dobdc) and Co2(m-dobdc) were evaluated for the separation of xylene isomers.",

      "question": "How does the structural distortion of Co2(dobdc) upon binding o-xylene or ethylbenzene affect its adsorption properties?",
      "answer": "The structural distortion of Co2(dobdc) upon binding o-xylene or ethylbenzene allows the accommodation of additional adsorbate molecules, significantly increasing its adsorption capacity for these isomers.",

      "question": "What is the significance of the interaction between the C8 isomers and the exposed cobalt(II) sites in the metal–organic frameworks?",
      "answer": "The interaction between the C8 isomers and the exposed cobalt(II) sites is significant because it underlies the ability of the frameworks to bind and differentiate the isomers, contributing to the selectivity of the separation process.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The selectivity of Co2(dobdc) for the different C8 isomers is attributed solely to arene π–π interactions.",
      "answer": "False. The selectivity of Co2(dobdc) for the different C8 isomers is attributed to nuanced differences in the interaction of the isomers with two adjacent cobalt(II) centers, not solely to arene π–π interactions.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: Co2(m-dobdc) exhibits pore distortion upon binding any of the isomers at the investigated temperatures.",
      "answer": "False. Co2(m-dobdc) does not exhibit pore distortion upon binding any of the isomers at the investigated temperatures.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does the structural flexibility of Co2(dobdc) play in the separation of xylene isomers?",
      "answer": "The structural flexibility of Co2(dobdc), demonstrated by its distortion upon binding certain isomers, plays a role in enhancing its adsorption properties and selectivity for the separation of xylene isomers by allowing the accommodation of additional adsorbate molecules.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How were the adsorption isotherms for the C8 isomers obtained in the study?",
      "answer": "The adsorption isotherms for the C8 isomers were obtained through single-component vapor-phase adsorption measurements at different temperatures.",

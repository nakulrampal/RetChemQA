      "question": "What is the relationship between the synthesis conditions of Zn2(TCPE-d16)(DEF)2·2DEF (1a) and its structural transformation upon heating?",
      "answer": "The synthesis of Zn2(TCPE-d16)(DEF)2·2DEF (1a) involves heating a solution of H4TCPE-d16 and Zn(NO3)2·6H2O in a mixture of ethanol and N,N-diethylformamide (DEF) at 75 °C for 3 days. Upon heating above 150 °C, 1a undergoes significant structural changes, losing both bound and unbound DEF molecules, and transforms into a new phase, 1c, where fused 2D sheets bring phenyl rings on adjacent TPE cores in close proximity.",

      "question": "How does the activation energy for phenyl ring flipping in 1b compare to that in free TPE, and what implications does this have for fluorescence in the MOF?",
      "answer": "The experimentally determined activation energy for phenyl ring flipping in 1b is 43(6) kJ/mol, which is larger than that expected for free TPE by approximately 20 kJ/mol. This suggests that the torsion of the phenyl ring in 1b is impeded relative to solution-phase TPE, likely causing fluorescence turn-on in the TPE-based MOF.",

      "question": "What structural feature of 1b contributes to its higher activation energy for phenyl ring flipping compared to TPE?",
      "answer": "The higher activation energy for phenyl ring flipping in 1b compared to TPE is attributed to the drawing of the TPE core by the framework in 1b, which forces steric interactions to occur during the ring flipping process.",

      "answer": "The synthesis of H4TCPE-d16 from perdeuterated benzene allows for the creation of a deuterated TPE-based MOF, which is structurally analogous to 1H. This enables the use of 2H NMR spectroscopy to determine the activation barrier for phenyl ring flipping in the material, contributing to the understanding of fluorescence turn-on mechanisms in MOFs.",

      "answer": "The Pake patterns observed in the 2H NMR spectra of 1a and 1c indicate the presence of slow exchange regimes for phenyl ring motion, with the patterns persisting up to certain temperatures. This provides evidence for the activation of phenyl ring flips upon heating and the influence of guest solvent molecules on the dynamics.",

      "question": "How do the structural changes in 1a upon heating above 150 °C affect its fluorescence properties?",
      "answer": "Heating 1a above 150 °C causes loss of both bound and unbound DEF molecules and significant structural changes, leading to the formation of 1c. These changes bring phenyl rings on adjacent TPE cores in close proximity, potentially affecting the fluorescence properties by altering the phenyl ring dynamics.",

      "question": "What is the purpose of using a MOF nanospace in the study?",
      "answer": "The purpose of using a MOF nanospace in the study is to confine trans-4-styrylpyridine (4-spy) as a reactive substrate, allowing [2+2] cycloadducts to be selectively obtained even when the distance between two C=C bonds of 4-spy in the crystal is much larger than the conventional observed upper limit.",

    {
      "question": "How does the temperature affect the photodimerization ratio in the study?",
      "answer": "The photodimerization ratio increases proportionally with the reaction temperature ranging from -70 to 30 °C, indicating that higher temperatures increase the ratio of local 4-spy proximity due to increased molecular motion. However, the ratio decreases as the temperature increases beyond 30 °C, suggesting that too fast molecular motion at high temperatures reduces the time for reaction centers to overlap, decreasing the reaction ratio.",

    {
      "question": "Is the presence of guest molecules in the pore necessary for the photocycloaddition reaction to occur?",
      "answer": "No, the presence of guest molecules in the pore is not necessary for the photocycloaddition reaction to occur, as photoreaction performed on guest-free MOF-H showed a similar reaction ratio.",

      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What method was used to remove solvent molecules from MOF-H before the photocycloaddition reaction?",
      "answer": "Solvent molecules in MOF-H were removed by heating as-synthesized crystals at 200 °C under a dynamic vacuum for five days.",

      "question": "What was the longest dC=C reported so far where the photoproduct is determined crystallographically?",

    {
      "question": "How does the MOF-H structure change upon UV irradiation according to PXRD patterns?",
      "answer": "Upon UV irradiation, the PXRD patterns of MOF-H show that the 200 peak shifts to the high-angle side and the 002 peak shifts to the low-angle side, indicating that the structure shrinks along the a-axis and the layers stretch toward the c-axis.",

    },
    {
      "question": "Does the thermal expansion of the crystal affect the reactivity of 4-spy in MOF-H?",
      "answer": "No, the thermal expansion of the crystal has little effect on the reactivity of 4-spy in MOF-H, as the dC=C was almost unchanged with changing temperature, suggesting that thermal expansion does not significantly influence the reaction.",

      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of the 'swing' motion of 4-spy in the nanospace of MOF-H?",
      "answer": "The 'swing' motion of 4-spy in the nanospace of MOF-H causes the transient proximity of the two 4-spy molecules, facilitating the [2+2] photocycloaddition reaction despite the longer distance between the double bonds than previously reported.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the porosity of MOF-H maintained after UV irradiation?",
      "answer": "Yes, the porosity of MOF-H is maintained even after UV irradiation, as indicated by CO2 sorption experiments showing that the amount of adsorption did not change after UV irradiation.",

      "question": "What synthetic method was used to prepare [Zn(hfp)(4-spy)]·DMF (MOF-H)?",
      "answer": "To prepare [Zn(hfp)(4-spy)]·DMF (MOF-H), a mixture of 4,4′-(hexafluoroisopropylidene)bis(benzoic acid) (H2hfp), trans-4-styrylpyridine (4-spy), and Zn(NO3)2·6H2O in DMF was heated at 100 °C for two days in a teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave bomb.",

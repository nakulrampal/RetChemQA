    },
    {
      "question": "How does the presence of protecting groups on the glycosyl unit affect the glycosylation reaction?",

    },
    {
      "question": "What experimental evidence supports the proposed mechanism for generating glycosyl radicals from sulfinates under acidic conditions?",
      "answer": "Experimental evidence supporting the proposed mechanism includes the observation that unreacted sugar donor and tBuOOH coexist without noticeable change, indicating slow direct electron transfer, and the significant impact of TFA and TBAI on the reaction rate.",

    {
      "question": "What is the role of tert-butoxyl radical in the proposed reaction mechanism for glycosylation?",
      "answer": "The tert-butoxyl radical, generated from the decomposition of tBuOOH, abstracts a hydrogen atom from sulfinic acid to afford sulfonyl radical, which then loses SO2 to form glycosyl radicals. It also assists in rearomatization, initiating the next round of the process.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the glycosylation reaction described in the study compatible with water as a solvent?",

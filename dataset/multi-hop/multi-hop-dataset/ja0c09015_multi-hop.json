      "question": "How does the linker distribution affect the photocatalytic activity of multivariate mesoporous crystals?",
      "answer": "The linker distribution controls the photocatalytic activity of multivariate mesoporous crystals by affecting the concentration and distribution of photoactive linkers within the crystal structure, which in turn influences the electronic structure and optical properties, ultimately impacting the photocatalytic performance.",

      "question": "What is the effect of increasing the reaction time on the distribution of TZDC linkers in UiO-68-TZDC10% crystals?",
      "answer": "Increasing the reaction time leads to a more homogeneous distribution of TZDC linkers across the UiO-68-TZDC10% crystals, as opposed to a core-shell distribution observed at shorter reaction times.",

    {
      "question": "Does the incorporation of TZDC linkers into UiO-68 framework lead to a decrease in BET surface area?",
      "answer": "Yes, the incorporation of TZDC linkers into the UiO-68 framework leads to a slight decrease in BET surface area as observed in UiO-68-TZDC% samples compared to the original UiO-68.",

    {
      "question": "Is the photocatalytic activity of UiO-68-TZDC% samples for hydrogen evolution reaction directly proportional to the TZDC content?",
      "answer": "No, the photocatalytic activity of UiO-68-TZDC% samples for hydrogen evolution reaction is not directly proportional to the TZDC content. The activity increases up to a certain TZDC content and then decreases, suggesting an optimal TZDC concentration for maximum photocatalytic efficiency.",

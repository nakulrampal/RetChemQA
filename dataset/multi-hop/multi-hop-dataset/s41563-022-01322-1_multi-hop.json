      "question": "What is the primary mechanism responsible for the ferroelectricity observed in CCC?",
      "answer": "The primary mechanism responsible for the ferroelectricity observed in CCC is geometric ferroelectricity, where the inversion symmetry is broken due to the geometric frustration of oxygen ions once the rotational dynamics of crown-ethers are frozen.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does the interlayer sliding contribute to the overall polarization in CCC?",
      "answer": "The interlayer sliding contributes to the overall polarization in CCC by generating a comparable ferroelectric polarization that superposes on the geometric one along the b axis, accounting for 57.4% of the total polarization.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What experimental technique was used to directly observe sliding ferroelectricity in CCC?",
      "answer": "Direct observation of sliding ferroelectricity in CCC was achieved using polarization-electric field hysteresis measurements, facilitated by the large bandgap of CCC which allows direct measurement of polarization.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role do crown-ethers play in the ferroelectricity of CCC?",
      "answer": "In CCC, crown-ethers act as rotators above the critical temperature (TC) and their geometric frustration upon freezing below TC leads to the breaking of inversion symmetry, contributing to geometric ferroelectricity.",

    {
      "question": "How does the temperature-dependent solid-state NMR spectroscopy support the existence of amphidynamic properties in CCC?",
      "answer": "The temperature-dependent solid-state NMR spectroscopy supports the existence of amphidynamic properties in CCC by showing a signal-narrowing phenomenon, indicating the gradually increasing motions of crown-ether with increasing temperature.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the phase transition observed at TC = 320 K in CCC?",
      "answer": "The phase transition observed at TC = 320 K in CCC signifies the transition from a high-temperature phase (HTP) with dynamic disorder of crown-ethers to a low-temperature phase (LTP) where the crown-ethers are frozen, leading to the onset of ferroelectricity.",

    {
      "question": "How does the synthesis condition of CCC influence its ferroelectric properties?",
      "answer": "The synthesis condition of CCC, involving slow evaporation of a methanol solution containing stoichiometric amounts of CdCl2 and 15-crown-5 at room temperature, influences its ferroelectric properties by ensuring phase purity and proper formation of the amphidynamic crystal structure necessary for ferroelectricity.",

    {
      "question": "Explain the relationship between the geometric and sliding components of ferroelectricity in CCC.",
      "answer": "In CCC, the geometric and sliding components of ferroelectricity are coupled, with the geometric component breaking the inversion symmetry and enabling unidirectional sliding. The sliding component is secondary to the geometric one, and both components positively superpose to contribute to the net polarization along the b axis.",

    {
      "question": "What experimental evidence supports the presence of ferroelectric domain structures in CCC?",
      "answer": "The presence of ferroelectric domain structures in CCC is supported by piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) imaging, which reveals domain textures and demonstrates the switchable ferroelectricity of CCC by showing reversible domain switching upon applying bias voltages.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the bandgap of CCC facilitate the direct measurement of its ferroelectric properties?",
      "answer": "The large bandgap of CCC facilitates the direct measurement of its ferroelectric properties by making the crystal highly insulating, thus reducing leakage currents in ferroelectric measurements and allowing for reliable polarization-electric field hysteresis measurements.",

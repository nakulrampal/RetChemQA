      "question": "How does the synthesis of nano-MV-PCN-521 differ from that of MV-PCN-521, and what are the implications for their use in sensing applications?",
      "answer": "The synthesis of nano-MV-PCN-521 involves vigorous stirring in the reaction solution, leading to nanocrystals with a higher percentage of TBPA and a change in crystal shape from octahedral to truncated cube. This allows for a more homogeneous distribution of metal-binding sites, making nano-MV-PCN-521 more suitable for sensing applications due to improved sensitivity and specificity.",

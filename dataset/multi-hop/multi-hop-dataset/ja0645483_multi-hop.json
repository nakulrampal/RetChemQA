      "question": "How does the choice of anion affect the topology of the resultant MOF network?",
      "answer": "The choice of anion was found to have a pronounced effect on the MOF topology, with networks prepared with salts of AgO3SCF3 and AgBF4 reliably forming three-dimensional (10,3) nets, whereas use of AgPF6 and AgSbF6 produced two-dimensional (6,3) honeycomb nets.",

      "answer": "Modification of the metalloligand from a pyridyl to a quinolyl-derivatized dipyrrin does not substantially change the overall MOF topology, and the templating effect of the anion is preserved.",

      "question": "What is the significance of the observation that MOF-Co/AgOTf-1 can accommodate larger anions like PF6-?",
      "answer": "The observation signifies that differences in anion size alone are not sufficient to explain the templating effect, as the (10,3) nets can accommodate larger anions with minimal structural perturbations.",

      "question": "How does the process of annealing affect the structure of FMOF-1 to create FMOF-2?",
      "answer": "Annealing FMOF-1 at approximately 300 °C overnight leads to a phase transition that enlarges the cage size around the channels, effectively doubling the toluene solvate content per AgTz unit in FMOF-2.",

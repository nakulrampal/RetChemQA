    },
    {
      "question": "What method was used to analyze single crystals of STAM-1?",
      "answer": "Single crystals of STAM-1 were analyzed using a Rigaku Mercury CCD equipped with graphite monochromated Mo-KÎ± radiation.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the esterification process in the synthesis of STAM-1?",
      "answer": "The esterification process during the synthesis of STAM-1 selectively forms the mono-methyl derivative of BTC, leading to a material with unique hydrophilic and hydrophobic channels.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the adsorption behavior of STAM-1 differ between CO2 and methanol?",
      "answer": "CO2 shows lower total pore volumes indicating adsorption in one type of pore, while methanol shows higher accessible volumes and a gated adsorption process, indicating adsorption in both types of pores.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does copper play in the synthesis of STAM-1?",
      "answer": "Copper is vital for the esterification process during the synthesis of STAM-1, as replacing copper with other metals does not result in the same esterification process.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What structural change occurs in STAM-1 upon dehydration?",
      "answer": "Upon dehydration, STAM-1 undergoes a subtle structural change that lowers its symmetry from trigonal to triclinic and closes one of the channels.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can STAM-1 be used as a protecting group for selective transformations?",
      "answer": "Yes, STAM-1 acts as a protecting group for two of the three carboxylic acid units of BTC, enabling functionalization of only one of the acid groups and demonstrating a high-yielding synthetic methodology.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the effect of exposing dehydrated STAM-1 to water or methanol?",
      "answer": "Exposing dehydrated STAM-1 to water or methanol reverses the structural changes that occurred upon dehydration, reopening the closed channel.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the esterification process during the synthesis of STAM-1 selective?",

    {
      "question": "Does activation of STAM-1 at 298 K remove all water from the material?",
      "answer": "False",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "Are the kinetic adsorption effects for N2 and O2 the same in STAM-1?",
      "answer": "False",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can STAM-1 be used for air separation through kinetic effects?",

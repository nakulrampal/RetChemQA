      "question": "How does the chiral nature of MOFs 1a and 1b contribute to their ability to perform enantioselective adsorption and separation?",
      "answer": "The chiral nature of MOFs 1a and 1b, due to their construction from enantiopure tetracarboxylate-bridging ligands and manganese carboxylate chains, contributes to their ability to perform enantioselective adsorption and separation by creating a microenvironment that can discriminate between enantiomers based on different orientations and binding energies.",

    {
      "question": "What role do the chiral dihydroxyl groups in MOF 1a play in the enantioselective adsorption and separation process?",
      "answer": "The chiral dihydroxyl groups in MOF 1a play a crucial role in the enantioselective adsorption and separation process by creating a microenvironment that favors the selective recognition and binding of specific enantiomers, contributing to the overall enantioselectivity of the MOF.",

    {
      "question": "True or False: The ligand methyl ester Me4L can form a 1:1 adduct with 2-butylamine or 1-PEA by crystallization with significant enantioselectivity.",
      "answer": "False. The ligand methyl ester Me4L can form a 1:1 adduct with 2-butylamine or 1-PEA by crystallization, but almost no enantioselectivity was observed for the examined amines.",

      "question": "What is the significance of the chiral dihydroxyl groups' contribution to the enantioselective separation process in MOF 1a?",
      "answer": "The significance of the chiral dihydroxyl groups' contribution to the enantioselective separation process in MOF 1a lies in their crucial role in creating a microenvironment that enables the selective recognition and binding of specific enantiomers, thereby enhancing the enantioselectivity of the MOF.",

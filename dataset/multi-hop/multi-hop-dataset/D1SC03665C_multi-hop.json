      "question": "What is the primary advantage of using mechanochemistry for the synthesis of boron imidazolate frameworks (BIFs) compared to traditional solvothermal methods?",
      "answer": "The primary advantage of using mechanochemistry for the synthesis of BIFs is that it enables rapid, room-temperature synthesis without the need for bulk solvents, high temperatures, or harsh reactants like n-butyllithium, making the process simpler, safer, and more efficient.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the mechanochemical synthesis of BIFs contribute to the exploration of new materials?",
      "answer": "Mechanochemical synthesis contributes to the exploration of new materials by enabling the preparation of previously unreported systems, such as BIFs with Ag(I) nodes, expanding the scope of accessible materials beyond those achievable with traditional solvothermal methods.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does the liquid-assisted grinding (LAG) technique play in the mechanochemical synthesis of BIFs?",
      "answer": "The LAG technique plays a crucial role in the mechanochemical synthesis of BIFs by enhancing reactant conversion and enabling the complete formation of BIFs alongside the desired byproducts, such as NaCl, within a short milling time.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is the use of amb in the mechanochemical synthesis of BIFs considered effective?",
      "answer": "The use of amb (2-aminobutanol) in the mechanochemical synthesis of BIFs is considered effective because it leads to an effective strategy for the selective synthesis of both dia- and SOD-topology BIFs, potentially by increasing the reactivity of the ligand and hindering the rearrangement of open-structure BIFs into denser polymorphs.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The mechanochemical synthesis of BIFs requires the use of bulk solvents and high temperatures.",
      "answer": "False",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of achieving higher surface areas in mechanochemically synthesized BIFs compared to those prepared solvothermally?",
      "answer": "Achieving higher surface areas in mechanochemically synthesized BIFs is significant because it indicates improved porosity, which can enhance the material's performance in applications such as gas storage, separation, and catalysis, demonstrating the efficiency of mechanochemistry in producing materials with superior properties.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the atomic number of metal nodes affect the stability of BIF polymorphs?",
      "answer": "The atomic number of metal nodes affects the stability of BIF polymorphs by increasing the stabilization of the open-framework SOD-topology structure relative to the close-packed dia-polymorph as the atomic number increases, indicating that heavier metal nodes favor the formation of more stable open-framework structures.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: Mechanochemical conditions enabled the synthesis of copper-based BIFs without the need for amb.",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What experimental techniques were used to characterize the mechanochemically synthesized BIFs?",
      "answer": "The mechanochemically synthesized BIFs were characterized using techniques such as powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR-ATR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), nitrogen sorption measurements, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) spectroscopy.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The mechanochemical synthesis of BIFs allows for the selective synthesis of both dia- and SOD-topology BIFs by adjusting the liquid-to-solid ratio.",

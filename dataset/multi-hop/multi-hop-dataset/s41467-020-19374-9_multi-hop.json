      "question": "What are the implications of SCU-103's performance in removing 99TcO4− from SRS HLW stream for nuclear waste management?",
      "answer": "The implications of SCU-103's performance in removing 99TcO4− from SRS HLW stream for nuclear waste management are significant, as it demonstrates a potential solution for the long-term issue of nuclear safety and environmental protection by effectively dealing with one of the most problematic radionuclides under extreme waste conditions.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does the structural design of SCU-103 contribute to its effectiveness in anion exchange and radiation resistance?",
      "answer": "The structural design of SCU-103, featuring concave–convex layers with sterically crowded metal centers, contributes to its effectiveness in anion exchange by providing suitable recognition sites for selective incorporation of 99TcO4− and resistance to H2O and OH− attack under basic conditions, as well as its radiation resistance by stabilizing radiation-induced radicals.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The reviewers unanimously agreed on the high novelty of Sakai and co-workers' research from the beginning.",
      "answer": "False. The reviewers had mixed opinions on the novelty of the research initially, with concerns about the novelty being diminished due to related work in the field. However, they recognized the improvements made in the revised manuscript.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: Sakai and co-workers' research did not face any challenges related to the crystallographic analysis of their synthesized Pt double salts.",
      "answer": "False. Sakai and co-workers faced several challenges related to the crystallographic analysis, including issues with dataset quality and treatment of disorder, which were addressed in the revised manuscript.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The potential applications of the Pt double salts in catalysis and as medicines were fully explored and presented in Sakai and co-workers' manuscript.",
      "answer": "False. While potential applications were hinted at, the reviewers noted the absence of initial results for these applications in the manuscript and suggested that further exploration might be beneficial.",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "How did Sakai and co-workers address the issue of solubility in relation to the potential medicinal applications of the Pt double salts?",
      "answer": "Sakai and co-workers acknowledged the complexity of the solution chemistry and the challenge of predicting the effects on redox chemistry. They indicated that solubility can be controlled, but detailed exploration of this aspect is part of their future research direction.",

    {
      "question": "What is the effect of supercritical CO2 drying on the MOF structure compared to direct thermal evacuation?",
      "answer": "Supercritical CO2 drying can be used to access a guest-free open phase, while direct thermal evacuation often leads to irreversible framework changes that reduce porosity.",
      "difficulty": "hard",

      "question": "What is the structural difference between phase 1 B and 1 C of the MOF?",
      "answer": "Phase 1 B is a collapsed framework free of guest molecules, while 1 C is an open framework free of guest molecules.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of phenyl groups in the synthesis of the MOF?",
      "answer": "Phenyl groups were appended to the dicarboxylic acid bridging ligand to prevent interpenetration, thereby increasing the potential free volume.",

    },
    {
      "question": "Why is the first cycle of CO2 sorption–desorption omitted from the analysis of systematic decline in sorption capacity?",
      "answer": "The first sorption experiment conditions the sample for subsequent gas inclusion, implying a 'memory' effect, which makes it different from subsequent cycles.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What indicates the reversibility of the MOF's breathing behavior?",

    {
      "question": "How does the sorption selectivity of MOF for CO2 over N2 and CH4 compare?",

      "answer": "The presence of residual DMF interferes with the activation process via supercritical CO2 drying.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the sorption capacity of the MOF reduced to approximately 39% of its initial value after extended cycling?",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "Does the MOF maintain its single-crystal character after activation at 423 K under dynamic vacuum?",

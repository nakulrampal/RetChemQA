These materials, known as Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs), have been synthesized using various metals such as Cu, Zn, and Fe, and organic linkers like BDC, TDC, and others. The synthesis conditions, including the choice of metal, linker, solvent, and temperature, play a crucial role in determining the structure and properties of the resulting MOFs. MOFs have been named MOF-102 to MOF-112, each with unique structural characteristics.",

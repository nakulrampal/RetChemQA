          "answer": "The NOE difference spectrum observed in the 'H-NMR study of 1'@ confirms the curled-up conformation of the central ring, as it shows a clear Overhauser effect between hydrogen atoms of the 44-membered ring and the peripheral rings.",

          "answer": "The templating properties of transition metals were taken advantage of for interlocking coordinating acyclic leading to catenands after demetalation of the corresponding catenates. [3]-Catenanes consist of three interlocked rings and have been synthesized by Schill et al., while [3]-catenates have been prepared by using an oxidative coupling of terminal diynes.",

          "question": "How does the molecular structure of 1'@ contribute to its stability in solution?",
          "answer": "The curled-up geometry of 1'@ and the internal stacking observed contribute to its stability in solution, reminiscent of systems consisting of a cationic noble-metal complex linked to a large macrocyclic polyether which has to fold up to adjust its geometry to the shape of the bound transition-metal complex.",

          "question": "What evidence supports the notion that the molecular shapes of 1'@ in the solid state and in solution are analogous?",
          "answer": "The analogy between the molecular shapes in the solid state and in solution is confirmed by the observation of a nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) between hydrogen atoms of the 44-membered ring and the peripheral rings, indicating similar molecular conformations in both states.",

    {
      "question": "What is the main goal of synthesizing MOFs with dynamic components?",
      "answer": "The main goal is to achieve stimuli-responsive solids by building cooperativity and synchronization among dynamic components within MOFs.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the presence of the 24C8 macrocycle influence the dynamics of the central phenyl rotor in UWDM-9-d4?",
      "answer": "The presence of the 24C8 macrocycle influences the dynamics of the central phenyl rotor by restricting its dynamics at low temperatures, but at higher temperatures, it allows for the rotor to access low-energy conformations characteristic of the rotor 'wobble'.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What method was used to distinguish between complexed and uncomplexed benzimidazole recognition sites in UWDM-8, UWDM-9-d4, and UWDM-10?",
      "answer": "13C solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR) chemical shift was used to distinguish between complexed and uncomplexed benzimidazole recognition sites.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"

    {
      "question": "True or False: The study demonstrates that individual machine-like components can be brought together in a solid-state material to directly and physically influence each otherâ€™s behavior.",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What structural feature of the primary linker TTDC in UWDM-8 locks the 24C8 macrocycle in place?",
      "answer": "The four methyl groups attached to the central phenyl ring of the primary linker TTDC lock the 24C8 macrocycle in place.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the synthesis of UWDM-10 differ from that of UWDM-8 and UWCM-10?",
      "answer": "UWDM-10 was prepared by solvent-assisted linker exchange (SALE), which resulted in only partial (67%) incorporation of the H-shaped tetracarboxylate linker due to its bulk and denticity.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The dynamics of the rotor in UWDM-9-d4 are influenced by the translational position of the [2]rotaxane macrocycle.",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of using 2H SSNMR spectroscopy in the study of UWDM-9-d4 and UiO-68-d4?",
      "answer": "2H SSNMR spectroscopy was used to directly probe and compare the rotation of the central phenyl ring of the primary linker in both MOFs, revealing the influence of the 24C8 macrocycle on the rotor's dynamics.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"

    {
      "question": "True or False: The study found that the bulk and orientation of the central ring of the primary dicarboxylate linker do not affect the mobility of the 24C8 ring.",
      "answer": "False",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What does the study conclude about the future of molecular machines within MOFs?",
      "answer": "The study concludes that the future of molecular machines lies in organizing individual components to work together to perform various functions, demonstrating that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.",

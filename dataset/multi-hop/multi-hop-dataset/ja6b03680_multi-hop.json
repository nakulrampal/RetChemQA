      "question": "What are the synthesis conditions for Co-BTTri as described in the text?",
      "answer": "The synthesis conditions for Co-BTTri involve reacting CoCl2 with 1,3,5-tri(1H-1,2,3-triazol-5-yl)benzene (H3BTTri) in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and methanol, leading to the formation of Co-BTTri (Co3[(Co4Cl)3(BTTri)8]2·DMF), a sodalite-type metal–organic framework. The material is then desolvated to generate coordinatively unsaturated low-spin cobalt(II) centers.",

      "question": "How does the introduction of a pyrazolate group in place of a triazolate linker affect the O2 binding affinity in cobalt-based metal–organic frameworks?",
      "answer": "The introduction of a pyrazolate group in place of a triazolate linker, as seen in the transition from Co-BTTri to Co-BDTriP, leads to a markedly higher O2 binding affinity. This is evidenced by the higher isosteric heat of adsorption for O2 in Co-BDTriP compared to Co-BTTri.",

    {
      "question": "What is the role of the desolvation process in the synthesis of Co-BTTri and Co-BDTriP?",
      "answer": "The desolvation process in the synthesis of Co-BTTri and Co-BDTriP is crucial for generating coordinatively unsaturated low-spin cobalt(II) centers within the frameworks, which are responsible for their strong preference for binding O2 over N2.",

      "question": "True or False: The synthesis of H3BDTriP involves a step where the pyrazole ring is formed through the reaction of an iminium perchlorate salt with hydrazine monohydrate.",

      "question": "What experimental techniques were used to characterize the synthesized Co-BTTri and Co-BDTriP frameworks?",
      "answer": "The synthesized Co-BTTri and Co-BDTriP frameworks were characterized using powder X-ray diffraction, elemental analysis, 1H-NMR spectroscopy, and single crystal X-ray diffraction.",

      "question": "How does the presence of coordinatively unsaturated cobalt(II) centers in Co-BTTri and Co-BDTriP contribute to their gas adsorption properties?",
      "answer": "The presence of coordinatively unsaturated cobalt(II) centers in Co-BTTri and Co-BDTriP contributes to their gas adsorption properties by providing sites that have a strong preference for binding O2 over N2, which is crucial for their application in air separation processes.",

      "answer": "Quantum chemical calculations, including density functional theory (DFT), complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF), and second-order perturbation theory (CASPT2), were employed to gain insight into the electronic structures of Co-BTTri and Co-BDTriP.",

    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the isosteric heat of adsorption values obtained for O2 and N2 in Co-BTTri and Co-BDTriP?",
      "answer": "The significance of the isosteric heat of adsorption values for O2 and N2 in Co-BTTri and Co-BDTriP lies in their indication of the strength of interaction between the frameworks and the gases. Higher values for O2, especially in Co-BDTriP, demonstrate their potential for selective O2 adsorption, which is important for air separation applications.",

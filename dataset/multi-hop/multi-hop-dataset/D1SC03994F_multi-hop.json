      "question": "What are the key differences in NO adsorption behavior between Co2Cl2(bbta) and Co2(OH)2(bbta)?",
      "answer": "Co2Cl2(bbta) exhibits strong and reversible adsorption of NO at room temperature without significant electron transfer, while Co2(OH)2(bbta) shows charge transfer from cobalt(II) to NO upon adsorption, leading to the formation of a cobalt(III)–NO adduct. At higher pressures, Co2(OH)2(bbta) also facilitates disproportionation of NO to form cobalt(III)–nitro (NO2-) species and N2O gas.",

      "question": "How does the presence of a more basic bridging hydroxo ligand in Co2(OH)2(bbta) influence its NO adsorption and reactivity compared to Co2Cl2(bbta)?",
      "answer": "The more basic bridging hydroxo ligand in Co2(OH)2(bbta) promotes charge transfer from cobalt(II) to NO, leading to the formation of cobalt(III)–NO adducts. This charge transfer, along with hydrogen bonding interactions, facilitates disproportionation of NO at higher pressures, a behavior not observed in Co2Cl2(bbta).",

      "question": "Is the adsorption of NO in Co2Cl2(bbta) reversible, and how does it compare to Co2(OH)2(bbta) in terms of recyclability?",
      "answer": "Yes, the adsorption of NO in Co2Cl2(bbta) is reversible, and the material retains 97.4% of its adsorption capacity over three cycles with regeneration at 363 K. In contrast, Co2(OH)2(bbta)'s capacity is greatly reduced after one cycle, even with attempted regeneration at temperatures up to 423 K, indicating better recyclability for Co2Cl2(bbta).",

      "question": "True or False: Both Co2Cl2(bbta) and Co2(OH)2(bbta) exhibit the same level of affinity for NO and O2.",
      "answer": "False. Both frameworks exhibit a much higher affinity for NO than O2, with differences in their NO adsorption isotherms indicating distinct framework–gas interactions.",

    {
      "question": "What role does hydrogen bonding play in the adsorption and reactivity of NO in Co2(OH)2(bbta)?",
      "answer": "Hydrogen bonding between the bound NO (or NO2-) species and the framework's bridging hydroxo groups contributes significantly to the adsorption of NO at low pressures and promotes the disproportionation of NO to form cobalt(III)–nitro species and N2O gas at higher pressures.",

    {
      "question": "True or False: The structural changes upon NO binding in Co2Cl2(bbta) suggest a change in the cobalt oxidation or spin state.",
      "answer": "False. The structural changes upon NO binding in Co2Cl2(bbta) do not appear to be related to changes in the cobalt oxidation or spin state, as the cobalt–ligand bond lengths are consistent with those of high-spin cobalt(II).",

      "question": "How does the adsorption capacity of Co2(OH)2(bbta) for NO at 1 bar compare to other NO absorbents?",
      "answer": "The adsorption capacity of Co2(OH)2(bbta) for NO at 1 bar is one of the highest gravimetric capacities of any NO absorbent, reaching 10.1 mmol g-1 (23.3 wt%), which is higher than capacities observed for Fe2(dobdc), Ni2(dobdc), and UiO-66-NH2.",

    {
      "question": "True or False: The NO adsorption isotherms for Co2Cl2(bbta) and Co2(OH)2(bbta) at low pressures are significantly different.",
      "answer": "False. The NO adsorption isotherms for both materials at 298 K exhibit an initial steep rise at low pressures, indicative of strong framework–gas interactions, with only a slightly steeper uptake for Co2(OH)2(bbta) at low pressures.",

    {
      "question": "What evidence supports the formation of a cobalt(III)–nitrosyl species upon NO adsorption in Co2(OH)2(bbta)?",
      "answer": "Evidence for the formation of a cobalt(III)–nitrosyl species upon NO adsorption in Co2(OH)2(bbta) includes a significant decrease in the framework unit cell volume, changes in Co–Ntriazolate distances, and the presence of a bent Co–N–O angle consistent with cobalt(III)–nitrosyl species in the structural model.",

    {
      "question": "True or False: The adsorption of NO in Co2Cl2(bbta) leads to the formation of cobalt(III)–nitro species and N2O gas.",
      "answer": "False. It is Co2(OH)2(bbta) that, upon adsorption of NO at higher pressures, leads to the formation of cobalt(III)–nitro species and N2O gas through disproportionation, a behavior not observed in Co2Cl2(bbta).",

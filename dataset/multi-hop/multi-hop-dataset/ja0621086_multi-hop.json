    },
    {
      "question": "How does the presence of water molecules affect the adsorption of gases in MIL-96?",
      "answer": "The presence of water may limit the free volume for gas molecules and hinder the adsorption process, especially for methane due to its larger dimension.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The structure of MIL-96 collapses upon removal of water molecules.",

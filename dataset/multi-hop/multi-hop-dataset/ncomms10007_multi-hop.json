      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does the spatial arrangement of catalytic sites play in the tandem asymmetric transformation process?",
      "answer": "The orderly distributed and spatially matched multi-catalytic sites in the framework ensure compatibility between the reaction intermediates and synergy of the multiple catalytic cycles, driving the tandem catalytic process in an asymmetric fashion.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the structural simplicity of the building blocks contribute to the development of practical homochiral materials for CO2 conversion?",
      "answer": "The structural simplicity of the building blocks, combined with the use of inexpensive and readily available chemical reagents, renders the approach highly promising for the development of practical homochiral materials for CO2 conversion due to ease of synthesis and cost-effectiveness.",

      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the impact of the crystalline properties of POM-based homochiral MOFs on the analysis of catalytic processes?",
      "answer": "The intrinsic crystalline properties provide precise knowledge about the nature and distribution of catalytically active sites and about the interactions between the catalytic sites and the adsorbed substrates, facilitating analysis of the intermediates and the catalytic processes of each step of the tandem asymmetric transformation.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The synthesis of POMOFs involves a simple solvothermal reaction without the need for adjusting pH values.",
      "answer": "False",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the use of a heterogeneous catalyst in the conversion of CO2 to cyclic carbonates affect the reaction process?",
      "answer": "The use of a heterogeneous catalyst, such as ZnW (cid:2) PYI1, allows for the reaction to be carried out in a one-pot procedure without the need for sequential separation and purification processes, making the conversion of CO2 to cyclic carbonates more efficient and environmentally benign.",

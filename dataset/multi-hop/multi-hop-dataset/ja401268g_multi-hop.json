      "question": "What are the synthesis conditions for Cd(im)2 as described in the supplementary information?",
      "answer": "Single crystals of Cd(im)2 were prepared via slow diffusion of aqueous solutions (approximately 0.2 M) of cadmium(II) nitrate tetrahydrate (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%) and imidazole (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%). Deprotonation of the organic ligand was achieved by addition of a small quantity of ammonium hydroxide (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%). Crystals suitable for single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiments were obtained within 14 days. Polycrystalline samples of Cd(im)2 were obtained by direct precipitation from stoichiometric mixing of aqueous solutions of cadmium(II) nitrate tetrahydrate and imidazole. The resulting precipitate was washed (H2O), dried under vacuum, and finely ground.",

      "answer": "Variable-temperature single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiments were carried out on an Oxford Diffraction/Agilent SuperNova diffractometer (graphite-monochromated Mo Kα radiation, λ = 0.71073 Å) fitted with an Oxford Cryosystems Cryostream 600 open flow cooling device. Data were collected on a single crystal, mounted on a glass fiber with araldite at room temperature, on cooling from 500 to 100 K at intervals of 20 K, and then on heating from 110 to 310 K at intervals of 20 K. A single collection strategy was applied, scanning through a full ω circle and collecting to a resolution of 0.77 Å.",

      "answer": "Based on the single-crystal X-ray diffraction data presented in the supplementary information, the crystal structure of Cd(im)2 exhibits changes in lattice parameters (a, b, c) and volume (V) as a function of temperature. The data shows that as the temperature increases, there are systematic changes in the lattice parameters, indicating thermal expansion and structural changes within the Cd(im)2 framework. These changes are indicative of the material's response to thermal stimuli, reflecting adjustments in the atomic positions and bond lengths to accommodate the thermal energy.",

      "answer": "Based on the supplementary information, the polyhedral tilt parameter (ψ) in Cd(im)2 decreases as the temperature increases. This change indicates that the polyhedral units within the Cd(im)2 structure undergo tilting adjustments as a function of temperature, contributing to the overall thermal expansion behavior of the material. The decrease in the ψ angle with increasing temperature suggests a trend towards higher symmetry in the structure, reflecting the material's response to thermal energy.",

      "answer": "False. The crystallographic analysis of Cd(im)2 revealed that the cadmium–cadmium distances (connected via an imidazolate anion) and the cadmium–centroid–cadmium angle both increase as a function of temperature, while the cadmium–centroid (Cd–im) distances decrease. This indicates that the cadmium atoms move further apart, not closer, as the temperature increases.",

      "question": "What is the relationship between the framework density of MOFs and their 1PEF emission wavelength?",
      "answer": "Larger framework densities and ETTC populations in pristine MOFs lead to initial blue or cyan emissions with longer wavelengths.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does pressure treatment affect the 2PA threshold and cross-section in MOFs?",

      "question": "What is the effect of pressure on the emission color of MOFs?",

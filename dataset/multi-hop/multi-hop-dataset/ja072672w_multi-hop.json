      "question": "What are the synthesis conditions for the preparation of the mono-, di-, and trinuclear cyanoruthenate complexes?",
      "answer": "The synthesis conditions for the preparation of the mono-, di-, and trinuclear cyanoruthenate complexes involve the reaction of the tritopic ligand HAT with 3.6 equiv of K4[Ru(CN)6]·3H2O in aqueous acid (pH 1.3) at reflux for 48 hours.",

      "question": "What method was used to isolate the cyanoruthenate complexes as their sodium salts?",
      "answer": "The cyanoruthenate complexes were isolated as their sodium salts by ion-exchange chromatography on Sephadex QAE-25, eluting with aqueous NaI.",

      "question": "How were the cyanoruthenate complexes converted to their PPN+ salts?",

      "question": "What structural feature allows the trinuclear cyanoruthenate complex to act as an 8-connected node in coordination networks?",
      "answer": "The trinuclear cyanoruthenate complex acts as an 8-connected node in coordination networks due to the presence of up to 12 externally directed cyanide ligands, with 8 of these ligands being used in bridging interactions to propagate the network.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of the HAT ligand in the photophysical properties of the cyanoruthenate complexes?",
      "answer": "The HAT ligand contributes to the photophysical properties of the cyanoruthenate complexes by providing low-lying π* orbitals, which result in low energy and intense MLCT absorptions, contributing to the complexes' strong solvatochromism and panchromatic absorption of visible light in certain solvents.",

      "type": "reasoning"

    {
      "question": "True or False: The cyanoruthenate complexes exhibit strong solvatochromism due to interactions between the cyanide ligands and the solvent.",

      "type": "True or False"

    {
      "question": "True or False: The trinuclear cyanoruthenate complex can use all of its 12 cyanide ligands in bridging interactions within coordination networks.",

      "question": "What experimental technique was used to observe the non- or poorly luminescent excited states of the cyanoruthenate complexes in solution?",
      "answer": "Time-resolved infrared spectroscopy (TRIR) was used to observe the non- or poorly luminescent excited states of the cyanoruthenate complexes in solution.",

    {
      "question": "How does the presence of Ln(III) cations affect the luminescence of the cyanoruthenate complexes?",
      "answer": "The presence of Ln(III) cations, such as Nd(III) and Yb(III), substantially quenches the Ru(II)-based MLCT luminescence of the cyanoruthenate complexes due to photoinduced energy transfer from the complexes to the low-lying f−f levels of the Ln(III) cations, resulting in sensitized Ln(III)-based luminescence.",

      "type": "reasoning"

      "question": "True or False: The solvatochromic behavior of the cyanoruthenate complexes becomes more pronounced as the number of cyanide ligands increases.",

      "question": "What is the significance of using a 2D coordination space in the design of NKU-128?",
      "answer": "The 2D coordination space often possesses higher levels of structural flexibility due to less coordinative constraint, which prompts more sensitive or augmented stimuli-induced structural distortions.

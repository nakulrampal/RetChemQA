    {
      "question": "Which guest molecules were successfully exchanged in the 3D coordination network according to the study?",
      "answer": "Triphenylene (3a), anthracene (3b), perylene (3c), and triphenylphosphine oxide (3d)",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What was the observed effect on the crystals when large guest molecules were included in the 3D coordination network?",
      "answer": "Drastic color change due to strong donor-acceptor interactions between the electron-deficient ligand (1) and electron-rich guests (3a-c)",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How did the inclusion of triphenylphosphine oxide (3d) differ from the other guest molecules in terms of interaction with the ligand?",
      "answer": "There was no aromatic stacking between the nonplanar guest of 3d and the ligand of 1, unlike the planar guests which showed efficient stackings.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What was the role of cyclohexane in the guest exchange process?",
      "answer": "Cyclohexane was used as a solvent in which the crystals of 2 were immersed to facilitate the guest exchange process.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What method was used to convert the diffuse reflectance UV-vis spectra from reflection to absorbance?",
      "answer": "The Kubelka-Munk method",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What was the significance of the color change observed in the crystals during the guest exchange process?",
      "answer": "The color change indicated the formation of charge-transfer complexes due to donor-acceptor interactions between the guests and the ligand.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why was triphenylene (3a) found in three independent positions within the crystal structure?",
      "answer": "The 3D coordination network's large pores allowed for the inclusion of large guest molecules like triphenylene, which could occupy multiple positions due to the network's flexibility and space.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How did the guest exchange process affect the 3D coordination network's structure?",
      "answer": "Despite the inclusion of large guest molecules, the 3D net remains unchanged, and the cell parameters are almost the same as those of 2.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What was the outcome of attempting one pot complexation of ZnI2 and 1 in the presence of 3a?",
      "answer": "It resulted in the formation of a different complex from 4a, demonstrating the specificity of the guest exchange process.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why did the inclusion of triphenylphosphine oxide (3d) not result in a color change?",
      "answer": "The absence of aromatic stacking and the different nature of interaction between 3d and the ligand did not facilitate the formation of charge-transfer complexes that would cause a color change.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What was the effect of the HOMO-LUMO gap on the absorption band shift?",
      "answer": "As the HOMO-LUMO gap is smaller, the shift of the absorption band is larger, indicating stronger donor-acceptor interactions.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "The guest exchange process was irreversible. True or False?",

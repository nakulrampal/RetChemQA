      "question": "What is the primary method used for growing deuterated single crystals of [CuF2(H2O)2]2pyz?",
      "answer": "The primary method used for growing deuterated single crystals of [CuF2(H2O)2]2pyz is similar to the method described in Ref. [S1], involving the dissolution of deuterated ammonium fluoride and D4-pyrazine in water, followed by the addition of a filtered solution of copper(II) nitrate made from copper(II) chloride and silver(I) nitrate in water at 5°C, and allowing slow evaporation.",

      "question": "How does the TDO susceptometer used in the experiments work?",
      "answer": "The TDO susceptometer works based on an oscillator circuit with a tunnel diode and a resonant LC circuit where the sample is contained inside the inductor. The oscillation frequency is determined by the formula ω ∝ 1/√LC, where L is modified by the susceptibility of the sample.",

      "question": "What is the significance of the Néel temperature in the context of the experiments conducted?",
      "answer": "The Néel temperature is significant in the context of the experiments as it is used to determine the magnetic state of the sample by measuring the TDO resonance frequency as a function of temperature. The change of magnetic state is detectable as a kink in ω at the ordering temperature, which is determined from the initial kink in each curve.",

      "question": "How does the pressure affect the magnetic interactions in [CuF2(H2O)2]2pyz according to the study?",
      "answer": "According to the study, the pressure has a giant dependence on the magnetic interactions in [CuF2(H2O)2]2pyz, leading to a continuous reduction of the dominant exchange parameter by a factor of 2 on compression and inducing a phase transition above 18 kbar that switches the dimensionality, transforming the quasi-two-dimensional lattice into weakly coupled chains.",

      "answer": "The effect of pressure on [CuF2(H2O)2]2pyz is to dramatically change the Néel temperature and saturation field, with the Néel temperature showing a significant relative change over a wide pressure range and the saturation field experiencing dramatic changes with pressure.",

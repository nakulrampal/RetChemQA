      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "Considering the synthesis conditions, which MOF would be most suitable for capturing SF6 from SF6/N2 mixtures?",
      "answer": "Ni(ina)2, because it has perfect pore sizes (6 Å) that are comparable to the kinetic diameter of sulfur hexafluoride (5.2 Å), affording the benchmark binding affinity for SF6 gas.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does Cu(peba)2 exhibit the lowest SF6/N2 selectivity among the three MOFs discussed?",
      "answer": "Because it has a larger pore size, which results in weaker interactions between SF6 molecules and the MOF skeleton.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the pore size of Ni(ina)2 contribute to its high SF6/N2 selectivity?",
      "answer": "The pore size of Ni(ina)2 is close to the kinetic diameter of SF6, allowing for strong, multipoint van der Waals interactions, which contributes to its high SF6/N2 selectivity.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role do the kinetic adsorption effects play in the adsorption process of the three MOFs?",
      "answer": "The kinetic adsorption effects influence gas adsorption in the three MOFs not only by thermodynamics but also by kinetic adsorption effects, which is a synergistic effect in the adsorption procedure.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is Ni(ina)2 considered a promising candidate for SF6 capture and selective separation of SF6 and N2?",
      "answer": "Because Ni(ina)2 exhibits the highest SF6/N2 selectivity and ultra-high SF6 uptake capacity at ambient conditions, indicating strong interactions with SF6 molecules.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the SF6-loaded single-crystal structure provide insight into the adsorption/separation mechanism of Ni(ina)2?",
      "answer": "The SF6-loaded single-crystal structure reveals the SF6 binding site and demonstrates that Ni(ina)2's pore structure 'matches' perfectly with the SF6 molecule, allowing for strong, multipoint van der Waals interactions.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What evidence supports the strong adsorption affinity of Ni(ina)2 for SF6?",
      "answer": "The in situ TG-FTIR-MS results and the SF6-loaded single-crystal structure provide direct evidence of Ni(ina)2's strong adsorption affinity for SF6.",

    {
      "question": "What are the key components used in the synthesis of the MOF 1?",
      "answer": "Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, H3btc, and bpy",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the thickness of PSt-2 compare to PSt-1, and what determines this difference?",
      "answer": "PSt-2 is thicker than PSt-1, and the difference in thickness is determined by the length of the pillar ligand used in the host MOF structure.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What method is used to confirm the complete removal of the MOF host after polymerization?",
      "answer": "The complete removal of the MOF host is confirmed by X-ray powder diffractometry (XRPD), which shows the total absence of the XRPD pattern of the MOF.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The polymerization reaction for synthesizing polymer monosheets is not scalable.",
      "answer": "False",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of the MOF's nanospaces in the synthesis of polymer monosheets?",
      "answer": "The MOF's nanospaces act as reaction platforms, allowing for the controlled synthesis of unimolecularly thick polymer monosheets by confining the polymerization reaction to 2D directions.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What property of PSt-1 is significantly different from conventional linear polystyrene, and what causes this difference?",
      "answer": "PSt-1 has a lower glass transition temperature (Tg) compared to conventional linear polystyrene, which is caused by its unique 2D network topology that results in higher chain mobility.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The polymer monosheets synthesized using MOFs exhibit typical viscoelastic behavior similar to bulk polystyrene.",
      "answer": "False",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What experimental technique is used to analyze the size distribution of PSt-1 in solution?",
      "answer": "Dynamic light scattering (DLS) is used to analyze the size distribution of PSt-1 in solution.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the polymer–substrate affinity affect the morphology of polymer monosheets on different substrates?",
      "answer": "The polymer–substrate affinity affects the morphology of polymer monosheets, with stronger binding at the polymer/substrate interface leading to an expanded polymer sheet conformation, while lower affinity results in folded or aggregated particle morphologies.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The synthesis of polymer monosheets using MOFs requires highly symmetrical multivalent monomers.",
      "answer": "False",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    }

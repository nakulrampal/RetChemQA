      "question": "What is the process described for the synthesis of compound 3?",
      "answer": "Microcrystalline powder of compound 3 was synthesized by adding a methanol solution (8mL) of ZnCl2 (0.24 mmol) into a vigorously stirred nitrobenzene/methanol solution (32 mL/4 mL) containing TPT (0.16 mmol). Within 30 sec white powder was precipitated, which was then isolated in 68% yield by filtration.",

      "question": "How was compound 3c synthesized and what was its yield?",
      "answer": "Compound 3c was synthesized from a triple-layered solution consisting of a methanol solution (8 mL) of ZnCl2 (0.24 mmol) as the top layer, methanol (1 mL) as the middle layer, and a nitrobenzene/methanol solution (32 mL/4mL) of TPT (0.16 mmol) as the bottom layer. After 1 week, colorless needles were grown and isolated under microscope in 41% yield.",

      "question": "What was the method used for the purification of compound 3b, and what was the crude yield?",
      "answer": "Compound 3b was purified by heating 200 mg of compound 3 in a furnace at 573K for 60 hr, then increasing the temperature to 723K and keeping it for 4hr. Colorless crystals formed along with brown powder. The crystals were carefully separated from powder under microscope, resulting in a crude yield of 43%.",

      "question": "Describe the phase transition observed for compound 2 during heating and the final product obtained.",
      "answer": "Microcrystalline powder of network 2 showed two phase transitions from crystalline-to-amorphous-to-crystalline phase upon heating to 573 K. At 573 K, the formation of a new crystalline phase was evident, but the crystallinity was not good. Annealing of 2 at 573 K for 36 hours yielded a solid with good crystallinity, identified as compound 2a.",

    {
      "question": "What were the results of the TG-DSC plot for solid 1, and what does it indicate?",
      "answer": "The TG-DSC plot of solid 1 showed an exothermic peak at 573 K, indicating that a new phase is obtained. The release of solvent occurs before the formation of the exothermic peak, suggesting that cleavage and formation of coordination bonds occur to form compound 1a.",

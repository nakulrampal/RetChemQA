      "question": "What is the primary focus of the search for alternatives to chlorofluorocarbons?",
      "answer": "The search for acceptable alternatives has focused on hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) or hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) because they have relatively short atmospheric residence times.",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why might the use of HFCs and HCFCs lead to environmental concerns?",
      "answer": "The use of HFCs and HCFCs may lead to the accumulation of trifluoroacetate (TFA) in soils, which could prove toxic or inhibitory to plants and soil microbial communities.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What conditions were initially chosen for the study of TFA degradation and why?",
      "answer": "Anoxic sediments were initially chosen for the study of TFA degradation because of their ability to degrade CFCs and other halogenated methyl compounds.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What was the outcome when anoxic sediments from a San Francisco Bay saltmarsh were incubated with 2-'4C-TFA?",
      "answer": "Production of CH4 and 14CH4 in saltmarsh sediments only occurred when sulphate reduction was inhibited with molybdate or by elimination of sulphate from the slurry salts.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the degradation of TFA in anoxic conditions relate to methane production?",
      "answer": "The unlabelled carboxyl group of TFA was cleaved to CO2 in acetoclastic methanogenesis, leading to the production of CH4 and 14CH4.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What does the production of 14CH4 in the presence of 2-bromoethanesulphonic acid indicate about TFA degradation?",
      "answer": "The production of 14CH4 was blocked by 2-bromoethanesulphonic acid, an inhibitor of methanogenic bacteria, indicating that TFA degradation and methane production are microbial processes.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of finding that TFA can be degraded under both anoxic and oxic conditions?",
      "answer": "The ability of TFA to be degraded under both anoxic and oxic conditions implies that significant microbial sinks exist in nature for the elimination of TFA from the environment.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What potential environmental impact does the oxic degradation of TFA have?",
      "answer": "Oxic degradation of TFA leads to the formation of fluoroform, a potential ozone-depleting compound with a much longer atmospheric lifetime than the parent compounds.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the degradation of TFA in freshwater sediments compare to that in saltmarsh sediments?",
      "answer": "Unlike saltmarsh sediments where sulphate reduction needs to be inhibited, unmanipulated freshwater sediments readily produced 14CH4, indicating that TFA degradation can occur in various sediment types.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does molybdate play in the study of TFA degradation in saltmarsh sediments?",
      "answer": "Molybdate was used to inhibit sulphate reduction in saltmarsh sediments, which facilitated the production of CH4 and 14CH4 from TFA degradation.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the degradation of TFA a chemical or microbial phenomenon?",
      "answer": "The degradation of TFA is a microbial phenomenon, as indicated by the absence of 14CH4 production in autoclaved sediments containing molybdate.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Does the presence of sulphate affect the microbial degradation of TFA in saltmarsh sediments?",
      "answer": "Yes, the presence of sulphate affects the microbial degradation of TFA in saltmarsh sediments, as degradation and methane production only occurred when sulphate reduction was inhibited.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: TFA is highly resistant to bacterial attack.",

    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The use of HFCs and HCFCs does not lead to the formation of any environmentally persistent compounds.",
      "answer": "False. The use of HFCs and HCFCs leads to the formation of trifluoroacetate (TFA), which was initially thought to be highly resistant to degradation.",

    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: Methanogenic bacteria play no role in the degradation of TFA.",

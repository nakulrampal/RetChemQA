      "question": "What structural transition occurs in DUT-49 during the Negative Gas Adsorption phenomenon?",
      "answer": "During the Negative Gas Adsorption phenomenon, DUT-49 undergoes a structural transition from an open-pore structure (DUT-49op) to a contracted-pore structure (DUT-49cp).",

      "question": "What is the significance of the wide hysteresis loop observed in DUT-49's adsorption isotherms?",
      "answer": "The wide hysteresis loop observed in DUT-49's adsorption isotherms is significant because it indicates a large domain of metastability of the open pore phase, extending widely beyond the equilibrium transition, which is a prerequisite for the occurrence of Negative Gas Adsorption.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: Negative Gas Adsorption in DUT-49 can occur at thermodynamic equilibrium.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What theoretical condition is necessary for the occurrence of Negative Gas Adsorption in MOFs like DUT-49?",
      "answer": "A necessary theoretical condition for the occurrence of Negative Gas Adsorption in MOFs like DUT-49 is the existence of a two-state (bistable) porous material where the empty open pore form is thermodynamically more stable at working temperature, and a large domain of metastability of the open pore phase.",

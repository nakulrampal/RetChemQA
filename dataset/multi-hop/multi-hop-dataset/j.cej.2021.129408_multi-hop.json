      "question": "What are the synthesis conditions for hybrid 1?",
      "answer": "A mixture of Na2MoO4⋅2H2O (0.12 g, 0.50 mmol), BBTZ (0.03 g, 0.15 mmol), CuCl2⋅2H2O (0.03 g, 0.17 mmol), MnCl2⋅4H2O (0.03 g, 0.15 mmol), H3PO4 (0.50 mL, 7.5 mmol), and H2O (8.0 mL, 0.44 mol) was stirred for 30 min, and the pH was adjusted to 2.0 with NaOH. The mixture was then transferred to a Teflon-lined reactor and kept at 160 °C for 5 days.",

    {
      "question": "What unique property of lanthanide MOFs (LnMOFs) makes them attractive for sensing applications?",
      "answer": "LnMOFs have sharp and characteristic emissions, which can be modulated by analyte–metal and analyte–ligand interactions.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the luminescence turn-on mechanism of the LnMOF work for DMF vapor detection?",
      "answer": "The luminescence turn-on mechanism works by DMF–ligand interactions that shift the excited state energy level of the ligand, facilitating the ligand-to-metal energy transfer process.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of water molecules in the luminescence turn-on effect of the LnMOF sensor?",
      "answer": "The removal of coordinated water contributes to the turn-on effect by leaving fewer O–H bonds around the Eu centers, thus triggering enhancement of Eu emission.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does DMF cause a more significant change in the powder X-ray diffraction patterns of the LnMOF compared to other solvent vapors?",
      "answer": "DMF causes the most significant change because the MOF channels are built around DMF as the solvent template, leading to a breathing effect triggered by solvent adsorption.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What experimental evidence supports the hypothesis that DMF–ligand interactions are the major contributor to the luminescence turn-on effect?",
      "answer": "The evidence includes the much greater luminescence enhancement of the LnMOF after exposure to DMF vapor and the observation that the major contributor of the strong turn-on effect is the more efficient ligand-to-metal energy transfer process.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the LnMOF's selectivity for DMF vapor in industrial applications?",
      "answer": "Given the health concerns associated with DMF exposure in various industries, the LnMOF's selectivity for DMF vapor makes it a desirable reusable, selective, and easy-to-use sensor for detecting DMF vapor in the air.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the response rate of the LnMOF sensor to DMF vapor compare to its response to water vapor?",
      "answer": "The response rate of the LnMOF sensor to DMF vapor is quite fast, with 95% of turn-on achieved within a few minutes, which is comparable to its response to water vapor.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the presence of DMF in the solvent channels affect the luminescence of the LnMOF?",
      "answer": "The presence of DMF in the solvent channels presumably provides the right combination of the solvent media and the rotational constraint for the phenyl rings on the ligands, leading to a change in ligand energy levels that are more favorable for the ligand-to-metal energy transfer process.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What experimental setup was used to test the response rate of the LnMOF sensor?",
      "answer": "A prototype sensor setup was designed, where a powder of the LnMOF was attached on a glass slide with double-sided tape, and DMF and water vapors were introduced in an alternating manner.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What does the removal of water ligands from the Eu centers add to the turn-on effect?",
      "answer": "The removal of water ligands from the Eu centers adds to the turn-on effect as a minor contributor by enhancing the Eu emission.",

      "question": "How does the presence of fluorine atoms in compound 1 affect the Li–O bonds compared to the parent compound 4?",
      "answer": "In compound 1, the presence of fluorine atoms causes weakening of Li–O bonds and a reduction in the Li bond valence sum due to electron withdrawal from the carboxylate groups, resulting in expansion of LiO4 tetrahedra and an increase in the cell volume.",

      "answer": "The Young's modulus (E) and hardness (H) values correlate well with the packing index, indicating that short-range inter-ligand interactions are important for reducing mechanical compliance in these materials.",

    {
      "question": "Why does compound 2 exhibit a higher yield stress (sy) value compared to compounds 1 and 4?",
      "answer": "Compound 2 exhibits a higher yield stress (sy) value because the additional hydrogen bonding between ligands in 2 causes an increase in its sy value.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the presence of methyl substituents in compound 3 affect the crystal structure compared to the parent compound 4?",
      "answer": "The presence of bulky, hydrophobic methyl substituents in compound 3 causes large amounts of strain both in the cell volume and in the atomic structure, suggesting that steric interaction between neighboring methyl groups is reduced when a mixture of enantiomeric forms is present.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why might the HRS-PXRD data reveal some peak broadening in the solid solutions compared with the end members?",
      "answer": "The peak broadening in the solid solutions compared with the end members could be due to local strain effects or a slightly inhomogeneous distribution of the ligand within individual particles.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What does the variation in the ratio of peaks from suc and flu ligands in the FTIR spectra of 4·1 with x suggest about the structure?",
      "answer": "The variation in the ratio of peaks suggests that ligand mixing perturbs the structure, as indicated by the shift in the CO2 antisymmetric stretch to higher frequency owing to the presence of the other ligand.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the method of mechanochemical synthesis contribute to the stabilization of homogeneous mixed-ligand phases?",

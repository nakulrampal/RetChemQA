      "question": "Why is the interaction between mercury(II) ions and the NCS groups of the ruthenium dyes selective for mercury(II)?",
      "answer": "The interaction is selective for mercury(II) due to the unique coordination of mercury(II) ions to the sulfur atom of the NCS groups, which is not observed with other potentially competing metal cations.",

      "answer": "The presence of other metal ions such as lead(II), cadmium(II), zinc(II), or iron(II) does not affect the selectivity of the N719 and N749 dyes for mercury(II), as the color change is selective for mercury(II).",

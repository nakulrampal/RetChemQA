    {
      "question": "How does the magnetic behavior of material 3 compare to material 2?",
      "answer": "Material 3 exhibited similar magnetic properties to material 2, with higher magnetic saturations and a smaller coercive field, making its behavior more like superparamagnetism.",

    {
      "question": "Why was the thermal polymerization of [CN6CP]K conducted at 300°C without the assistance of Zn(II) salt?",
      "answer": "The close contact between the –CN groups and the K+ ions in the solid state of [CN6CP]K facilitated the triazination reaction without the need for Zn(II) salt.",

    {
      "question": "Is the observed magnetization in polymer 2 attributed to metal impurities?",
      "answer": "False. The total concentration of Fe, Ni, and Co was less than 0.1 ppm, indicating that the observed magnetization must come from the FM-coupled organic radical framework.",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "Did the preparation temperature for polymer 2 contribute to its low magnetic saturation?",
      "answer": "True. The preparation temperature was considered high, which might have led to partial degradation of the radicals and contributed to the low magnetic saturation.",

      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can the magnetic properties of polymer 3 be solely attributed to the presence of metal impurities?",
      "answer": "False. The total concentration of metal impurities was negligible, indicating that the magnetic properties are due to the organic framework itself.",

      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "Was the magnetic behavior of material 3 entirely different from that of material 2?",
      "answer": "False. Material 3 exhibited similar magnetic properties to material 2 but with higher magnetic saturations and behaved more like superparamagnetism.",

    },
    {
      "question": "Did the use of HOTf vapor in the polymerization of [CN6CP](n-TBA) require high temperatures?",
      "answer": "False. The polymerization was conducted at 60°C, indicating that HOTf vapor allowed the reaction to take place at relatively low temperatures.",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"

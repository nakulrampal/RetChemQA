      "question": "What is the synthesis method used for MIP-202(Zr) and how does it compare to other MOFs in terms of environmental friendliness?",
      "answer": "MIP-202(Zr) was synthesized by heating a mixture of ZrCl4 and L-aspartic acid in water for several hours under reflux with ambient pressure, followed by activation with green solvents like water and ethanol. This method is environmentally friendly, cost-effective, and scalable, contrasting with most other highly proton conductive MOFs that involve toxic chemicals, inconvenient ligand preparation, and are not scalable.",

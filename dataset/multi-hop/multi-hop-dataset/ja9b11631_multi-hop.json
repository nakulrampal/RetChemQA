    {
      "question": "What was the outcome when scandacyclopropenes were treated with phenylacetylene or TMSN3?",
      "answer": "When treated with phenylacetylene or TMSN3, scandacyclopropenes yielded the scandium complex of bis-phenylacetylide or bis-azide, respectively.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What reaction occurs between scandacyclopropene and phenazine according to the study?",
      "answer": "The reaction between scandacyclopropene and phenazine could provide the binuclear ring-opening scandium complex via 1,4-insertion of phenazine into one Scâ€“C bond and subsequent metathesis reaction.",

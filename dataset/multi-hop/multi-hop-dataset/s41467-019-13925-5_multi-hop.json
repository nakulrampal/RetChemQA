      "question": "What is the significance of the space group P622 in the context of the synthesis of metallo-organic single crystals?",
      "answer": "The space group P622 is significant because it indicates that the molecular packing within the synthesized metallo-organic single crystals is chiral. This space group is one of the 65 Sohncke groups, which are associated with chiral structures, and it is very rare, with only seven entries currently found in the Cambridge Crystallographic database. The presence of this space group suggests that the coordination of achiral organic ligands to a metal cation leads to an asymmetric environment, directing the formation of continuous homochiral channels within the crystal.",

      "question": "How does the solvothermal treatment contribute to the formation of yo-yo-like structures with chiral morphology?",
      "answer": "The solvothermal treatment of the achiral organic ligand (TPEPA) with Cu(NO3)2·3H2O in a chloroform/dimethylformamide (DMF) solution initiates the formation of morphologically achiral seeds. Over time, these seeds undergo a gradual development of homochirality, evolving into yo-yo-like structures with opposite helical handedness. This process involves the coordination of achiral organic ligands to a metal cation, leading to an asymmetric environment that directs the formation of continuous homochiral channels, resulting in the chiral morphology of the yo-yo-like structures.",

      "answer": "The solvothermal reaction conditions, specifically the treatment of the achiral organic ligand (TPEPA) with Cu(NO3)2·3H2O in a chloroform/dimethylformamide (DMF) solution at 105 °C, are crucial for the initial formation of uniform rod-shaped crystals and cylindrical structures. These conditions facilitate the coordination of achiral organic ligands to a metal cation, leading to the initial formation of morphologically achiral seeds. These seeds then undergo further morphological transformations and dimensional changes, contributing to the development of the complex chiral morphology observed in the final yo-yo-like structures.",

      "question": "How does the aging process at room temperature affect the morphology of the initially formed structures?",
      "answer": "The aging process at room temperature significantly affects the morphology of the initially formed structures by facilitating a series of morphological transformations and dimensional changes. After the solvothermal reaction, the aging process allows the initially formed rod-shaped crystals and cylindrical structures to evolve into more complex shapes, including elongated structures, prismatic objects with a hexagonal base, and eventually, yo-yo-like structures with chiral morphology. This process involves growth and development of texture, implying the start of new parallel growth processes and the continuous growth of the structures within the supersaturation range of the reaction solution.",

The diffraction patterns consist of well-defined and separated spots, indicating single crystallinity. The crystal structures were solved and refined to atomic resolution, revealing a chiral space group (P622). The enantiopurity is further confirmed by the calculated and experimental Flack parameters of entire yo-yo structures and their half-structures, which indicate that each crystal is enantiopure, and the bulk sample is racemic.",

      "answer": "The structural features of the yo-yo-like crystals contribute to their porosity through the network of helicates formed by metal-ligand interactions. The crystals exhibit hexagonal and triangular channels surrounded by six triangular channels, with the channels being perpendicular to the crystal surfaces. The inner walls defining the differently shaped channels have the same handiness within a single crystal, and the diameters of the hexagonal and triangular channels allow for porosity. These structural features result in an overall porosity of 39.7% of the unit cell, making the yo-yo-like crystals porous materials.",

      "answer": "The significance of the Jahn-Teller effect in the context of the crystal structures described in the study lies in its contribution to the distortion observed in the coordination geometry around the Cu2+ centers. The Jahn-Teller effect leads to a significant distortion, with metal-oxygen distances being larger than expected for a regular octahedron. This distortion is characteristic of d9 hexacoordinate Cu2+ and is indicative of the asymmetric environment created around the metal center, which is crucial for the induction of chirality in the crystal structures. The propeller-type arrangement of the pyridine moieties around the metal center, resulting from this distortion, generates the chiral packing observed in the crystals.",

The specific coordination interactions between pyridine moieties and metal ions, such as Cu2+, lead to the formation of continuous homochiral channels and chiral packing within the crystal structures. This rich coordination chemistry allows for the design and synthesis of new classes of fascinating materials that exhibit chirality at different hierarchies and possess unique properties, such as porosity, which can be exploited in various applications.",

      "question": "What challenges are associated with determining the absolute chirality of the crystals in the P622 space group?",
      "answer": "The challenges associated with determining the absolute chirality of the crystals in the P622 space group stem from the fact that this space group is one of the Sohncke groups, which are associated with chiral structures, but it does not have enantiomers like some other space groups. The enantiomer of P622 is also P622, making the determination of the absolute chirality of the crystals a challenge. The method used to overcome this challenge relies upon cross-validation using calculated Flack parameters, which allows for the determination of the relative chirality of individual crystals and the chiral composition of the bulk sample by comparing the hkl data and coordinates of different crystals.",

      "answer": "The presence of continuous homochiral channels within the crystals affects their potential applications by enabling the materials to exhibit properties related to chirality, such as enantioselective chemical transformations and separation. These homochiral channels, formed by the coordination of achiral organic ligands to a metal cation in a specific asymmetric environment, allow for the selective interaction with chiral molecules. This feature makes the crystals suitable for applications in areas such as catalysis, where the enantioselectivity can be crucial for the synthesis of chiral compounds, and in separation technologies, where the selective adsorption of enantiomers is desired. The unique chiral and porous nature of these materials opens up opportunities for their use in advanced functional applications.",

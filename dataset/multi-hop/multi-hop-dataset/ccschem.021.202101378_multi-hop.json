      "question": "What is the significance of using organotin in the synthesis of porphyrinic MOFs?",
      "answer": "Organotin was used in the synthesis of porphyrinic MOFs to impart hydrophobicity to the MOFs, improve their water stability, and enable the construction of MOFs with different types of topological networks. This approach offers a facile and effective method to enhance the environmental stability and functional properties of MOFs.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does the length of the ester group in organotin MOFs affect their hydrophobicity?",
      "answer": "As the length of the ester group in organotin MOFs increases, the materials become more hydrophobic. This is demonstrated by the higher water contact angles observed for MOFs with longer ester groups, indicating enhanced hydrophobic surface properties.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does the organotin play in the superhydrophobicity of SnTCPP-PTS and SnTCPP-SHE?",
      "answer": "The organotin plays a vital role in the superhydrophobicity of SnTCPP-PTS and SnTCPP-SHE by contributing to the hydrophobic nature of the MOFs. The presence of organotin in the SBUs of these MOFs enhances their external surface hydrophobicity, as evidenced by the high water contact angles observed.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What is the impact of SnTCPP-PTS's nanoscale structure on its practical applications?",
      "answer": "The nanoscale structure of SnTCPP-PTS facilitates its dispersion in solutions and easy coating on basal materials, making it highly effective for oil-water separation applications. Its nanoscale structure, combined with its hydrophobicity and stability, enables the efficient separation of oil from water and other pollutants.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: SnTCPP-SQL exhibits better chemical stability in acidic and alkaline environments compared to SnTCPP-PTS.",
      "answer": "False",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The BET surface area of SnTCPP-SHE is among the highest reported for hydrophobic MOFs.",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What experimental techniques were used to confirm the phase purity and formulas of the organotin MOFs?",
      "answer": "The phase purity and formulas of the organotin MOFs were confirmed using a combination of X-ray diffraction (XRD), elemental and thermogravimetric analyses (TGA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), and ultraviolet-visible (UV–vis, diffuse reflection spectroscopy.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the structural flexibility of SnTCPP-PTS contribute to its functionality?",
      "answer": "The structural flexibility of SnTCPP-PTS, indicated by the two-step CO2-trap isotherm and the shift in main PXRD peaks with temperature changes, contributes to its functionality by allowing for efficient CO2 capture and release. This flexibility also suggests potential applications in responsive materials and sensors.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The water contact angle of SnTCPP-PTS is less than 150°, making it hydrophilic.",
      "answer": "False",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the SnTCPP-PTS coated fabric's self-cleaning function?",
      "answer": "The self-cleaning function of the SnTCPP-PTS coated fabric is significant because it demonstrates the fabric's ability to repel water and maintain cleanliness without manual cleaning. This property is beneficial for applications requiring minimal maintenance and high durability, such as outdoor textiles and protective clothing.",

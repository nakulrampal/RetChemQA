      "question": "What is the chemical formula for silver(I) tricyanomethanide?",
      "answer": "Ag(tcm)",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What property does silver(I) tricyanomethanide exhibit under hydrostatic compression?",
      "answer": "Negative area compressibility (NAC)",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of negative area compressibility in materials?",
      "answer": "It allows materials to expand in two orthogonal directions under hydrostatic pressure, which is useful for developing artificial muscles, nanoscale actuators, and high-performance pressure sensors.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the crystal structure of Ag(tcm) contribute to its negative area compressibility?",
      "answer": "The crystal structure consists of stacked, doubly-interpenetrating honeycomb-like layers, where pressure-driven collapse of the interlayer separation couples with a reduction in layer rippling, increasing the layer cross-sectional area.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What experimental techniques were used to investigate the properties of Ag(tcm)?",
      "answer": "Single-crystal X-ray diffraction and variable-pressure neutron diffraction.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: Ag(tcm) exhibits isotropic area compressibility within the entire (a,c) plane.",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What potential applications are suggested for Ag(tcm) due to its unique properties?",
      "answer": "Ultra-high-precision sensing devices, piezoelectric and thermoelectric devices.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The phenomenon of negative compressibility is common among conventional engineering materials.",
      "answer": "False",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of layer rippling in the mechanism of negative area compressibility in Ag(tcm)?",
      "answer": "Layer rippling decreases under compression, which acts to increase the layer cross-sectional area, contributing to negative area compressibility.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The negative area compressibility of Ag(tcm) is weaker than the positive area compressibility of traditional engineering materials.",
      "answer": "False",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"

      "question": "What is the main challenge in capturing trace krypton (Kr) from used nuclear fuel (UNF) off-gas?",
      "answer": "The main challenge in capturing trace krypton (Kr) from used nuclear fuel (UNF) off-gas is due to low Kr uptake and poor Kr/N2 selectivity for current available adsorbents.",

    {
      "question": "What unique feature does DMOF-Th-1o have that contributes to its ultrahigh Kr uptake and record Kr/N2 selectivity?",
      "answer": "DMOF-Th-1o has a unique trap-type pore (3.8 Å) that perfectly matches with the kinetic diameter (3.7 Å) of Kr to exactly fix one Kr atom, while forms a unique Kr2 dimer with short Kr-Kr contact (4.18 Å).",

      "question": "How does the photochromic property of DMOF-Th-1o contribute to Kr/N2 separation?",
      "answer": "The photochromic property of DMOF-Th-1o, due to open-ring-to-closed-ring transformation under light irradiation, contributes to Kr/N2 separation by enabling a light-responsive separation switch.",

    {
      "question": "What method was used to enhance the open-ring-to-closed-ring transformation efficiency in DMOF-Th-1c?",
      "answer": "The method used to enhance the transformation efficiency in DMOF-Th-1c was by reducing the size of particle through grinding crystal samples.",

      "question": "What is the estimated transformation efficiency of DMOF-Th-1c based on the diagnostic peak in solid 13C MAS NMR?",
      "answer": "The transformation efficiency of DMOF-Th-1c is estimated to be 43%.",

      "question": "How does DMOF-Th-1c compare to DMOF-Th-1o in terms of Kr uptake and Kr/N2 selectivity?",
      "answer": "DMOF-Th-1c shows more steep Kr uptake below 0.1 bar compared to DMOF-Th-1o, resulting in a record-high Kr uptake of 13 cm3/g and higher Kr/N2 selectivity.",

      "question": "True or False: DMOF-Th-1o and DMOF-Th-1c have the same crystal system and space group.",

    {
      "question": "What is the role of the unique Kr2 dimer formation in the adsorption mechanism of Kr in DMOF-Th-1o?",
      "answer": "The formation of a unique Kr2 dimer in trap I of DMOF-Th-1o, with a short Kr-Kr contact, contributes to the ultrahigh Kr uptake and record Kr/N2 selectivity by providing strong Kr-Kr interaction and multiple van der Waals interactions.",

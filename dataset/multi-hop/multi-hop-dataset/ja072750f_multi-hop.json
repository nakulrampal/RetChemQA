          "question": "What is the significance of the quadratic decrease observed in the sum of all bond lengths around the trivalent metal cation?",
          "answer": "The quadratic decrease observed in the sum of all bond lengths around the trivalent metal cation is significant as it shows an almost ideal quadratic behavior across the entire series, providing a rational analysis and prediction of the geometric features of multidentate ligands for the chelation of rare-earth metals.",

          "question": "What potential impact does the result of the study have?",
          "answer": "The result of the study provides a significant advance for the prediction and rationalization of the geometric features of the corresponding lanthanide complexes, with great potential impact for all aspects of lanthanide coordination.",

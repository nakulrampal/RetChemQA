      "answer": "A mixture of 26 mg of 4‘-cis-DPyP (0.04 mmol) and 18.7 mg of trans-RuCl2(dmso-S)4 (0.04 mmol) dissolved in 5 mL of CHCl3 was allowed to react for 5 h at room temperature.",

      "answer": "Zn(CH3COO)2 is used to introduce zinc centers inside the porphyrin cores of the molecular square 5, leading to the formation of 5Zn.",

      "question": "How does the electronic absorption spectrum change upon the formation of 5Zn from 5?",
      "answer": "Upon the formation of 5Zn from 5, the four Q-bands of 5 collapse to two bands (552 and 590 nm); the Soret band shifts from 426 to 428 nm, accompanied by a decrease of intensity.",

      "answer": "Compound 6 exists as an equimolar mixture of the isomeric molecular squares 6a and 6b, depending on whether the 4’-N(py) moieties of each porphyrin are trans to one CO and one dmso-S ligand, respectively, resulting in different symmetries (C2v for 6a and C2h for 6b).",

      "answer": "The bathochromic shift observed in the Soret band during the formation of 7 from 5Zn is typical for axial coordination of N ligands to zinc porphyrins, indicating successful formation of the supramolecular adduct.",

      "answer": "Adding 4,4‘-bipy to a CDCl3 solution of 5Zn leads to the formation of [(5Zn)2(µ-4,4’-bipy)2] (7), as indicated by the appearance of relatively broad signals in the 1H NMR spectrum, which sharpen upon lowering the temperature, showing the formation of a supramolecular adduct of two molecular squares connected by two bridging ligands.",

      "question": "What changes occur in the 1H NMR spectrum of [(5Zn)2(µ-4,4’-bipy)2] (7) upon lowering the temperature?",
      "answer": "Upon lowering the temperature, the 1H NMR spectrum of 7 shows two sets of resonances, one relative to 5Zn and the other assigned to the 2:2 supramolecular adduct, indicating the formation of a discrete sandwich structure.",

      "answer": "No, the structure of 7 in the solid state is different from that found in solution. In the solid state, it consists of an infinite wire of 5Zn squares bridged by 4,4‘-bipy ligands, while in solution, it has a discrete sandwich-like architecture.",

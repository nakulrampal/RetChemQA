      "question": "What is the relationship between the electronegativity of the metals on the nodes and the catalytic performance of the MOF-supported catalysts?",
      "answer": "A better catalytic performance is correlated with a higher electronegativity of the metal ions on the node.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the electron-withdrawing ability of the metal nodes affect the catalytic activity of vanadium in MOF-supported catalysts?",
      "answer": "With a strong electron-withdrawing ability, the metal-oxygen bond becomes stronger, making the oxygen-vanadium bond weaker and the vanadium=oxygen bond stronger. This facilitates the oxygen on vanadium=oxygen to withdraw an electron from the substrate more easily, thus initiating the reaction more easily.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What method was used to confirm the vanadium loading amount in the synthesized MOF-supported catalysts?",
      "answer": "The vanadium loading amount was confirmed by Inductively-coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES).",

      "type": "factual"

      "question": "What was the purpose of using the PLATON SQUEEZE program in the refinement of V-Zr-NU-1200 and V-Hf-NU-1200 single crystal structures?",
      "answer": "The PLATON SQUEEZE program was used to remove the disordered non-coordinated solvents from the refinement.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the presence of Ce3+ in V-Ce-NU-1200 affect the detection of V3+ species using XPS?",
      "answer": "The paramagnetic nature of Ce3+ prevented the detection of V3+ species using XPS, indicating that the presence of Ce3+ interferes with the XPS measurement of vanadium oxidation states.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"

      "question": "True or False: The crystallinity of the MOF-supported catalysts was retained after the vanadium deposition and catalysis process.",

    {
      "question": "What was the role of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in the synthesis of the isostructural NU-1200 MOFs?",
      "answer": "Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) was used as the modulator to minimize the structural differences during the synthesis of the isostructural NU-1200 MOFs.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The oxidation state of vanadium in V-Zr-NU-1200 changed from +5 to a combination of +5 and +4 after 5 hours of reaction.",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What was the main finding from the EPR spectra obtained at different stages of the catalysis process for V-Zr-NU-1200 and V-Ce-NU-1200?",
      "answer": "The EPR spectra indicated the presence of more V4+ species during the reaction catalyzed by V-Zr-NU-1200, while V-Ce-NU-1200 supported vanadium species showed weak EPR signal, consistent with the XPS results showing no V4+ appeared even after 5 hours of reaction.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The pore size distribution and BET surface area of the MOFs significantly changed after the catalysis process.",
      "answer": "False",

      "question": "What are the synthesis conditions for CdSe quantum dots with uniform compositions?",
      "answer": "The synthesis conditions for CdSe quantum dots with uniform compositions involve mixing cadmium carboxylates and primary alkylamines with a highly reactive selenium precursor, bis(trimethylsilyl)selenide ((TMS)2Se), at room temperature or below. This results in the formation of CdSe quantum dots with compositions such as Cd35Se20(X)30(L)30, Cd56Se35(X)42(L)42, and Cd84Se56(X)56(L)56; where X = O2CPh and L = H2N-C4H9.",

      "question": "How does the size of CdSe quantum dots affect their UV-absorption spectra?",
      "answer": "The size of CdSe quantum dots affects their UV-absorption spectra by showing a lowest energy electronic transition that decreases in energy (3.54 eV, 3.26 eV, 3.04 eV) and sharpens as the size of the QD increases (fwhm = 207 meV, 145 meV, 115 meV).",

      "question": "What method was used to determine the structures of CdSe quantum dots that did not form diffraction-quality single crystals?",
      "answer": "For CdSe quantum dots that did not form diffraction-quality single crystals, their structures were determined using PDF analysis of total X-ray scattering from QD powders.",

    {
      "question": "What is the relationship between the size of CdSe quantum dots and their photoluminescence properties?",
      "answer": "The photoluminescence (PL) of CdSe quantum dots is broad and substantially Stokes-shifted but nonetheless size-dependent, indicating that larger QDs display band edge PL in addition to a broad trap-luminescence feature, suggesting that the large Stokes shift and broad line width of the PL are consequences of their very small size.",

    {
      "question": "How does the synthesis temperature affect the growth of CdSe quantum dots?",
      "answer": "The synthesis temperature affects the growth of CdSe quantum dots by controlling their conversion to larger sizes. Gently heating a solution of smaller CdSe quantum dots completely converts them into a mixture of larger sizes that can be separated by selective precipitation, demonstrating that higher reaction temperatures promote the growth of larger QDs.",

      "question": "True or False: The atomic structures of CdSe quantum dots reported in the study are derived from the zinc-blende lattice and are shaped as tetrahedra.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of determining the precise atomic structures of CdSe quantum dots?",
      "answer": "Determining the precise atomic structures of CdSe quantum dots is significant because it provides a direct view into the origins of QD stability and optical properties without ambiguities from distributions of crystal sizes and shapes and/or electronic transitions associated with the ligand shell, enabling detailed experimental and theoretical investigations into the relationship between geometric and electronic structure on the nanoscale.",

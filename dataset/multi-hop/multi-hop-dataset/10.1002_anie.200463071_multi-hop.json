      "question": "How does CB6 interact with the iodoaromatic moieties of copper(ii) complexes?",
      "answer": "The convex-shaped glycoluril backbones of CB6 exhibit a much higher affinity to the iodoaromatic moieties of the copper(ii) complexes than to the other CB6 units, resulting in the formation of helical 1D polymer arrays.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How are the helical structures of compounds 2 and 3 established?",

    },
    {
      "question": "How are compounds 2 and 3 synthesized from compound 1?",
      "answer": "Compounds 2 and 3 are synthesized by dissolving compound 1 in aqueous NaCl and adding the solution dropwise to an aqueous mixture of CuCl2, I2sal (or Ibz for compound 3), and Hqs at pH 6 under stirring, followed by slow evaporation.",

      "question": "What distinguishes the crystal structure of compound 1 from compounds 2 and 3?",
      "answer": "In compound 1, CB6 molecules display C2h symmetry and are connected by twofold O(1)-NaI-O(1) coordination linkages to form a linear 1D polymer, whereas in compounds 2 and 3, CB6 molecules are asymmetric and connected by asymmetric Om2(water)NaI dinuclear clusters, resulting in zig-zag, folded helical conformations.",

    {
      "question": "How does the synthesis of CB6 contribute to the formation of helical coordination polymers?",
      "answer": "CB6, synthesized by acid-catalyzed condensation of glycoluril and formaldehyde, forms more stable complexes with alkali metal ions than with transition metal ions, driving the assembly of alkali metal one-dimensional coordination polymers that incorporate transition metal complexes through shape-matching interactions.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of the anion-exchange strategy in the synthesis of the novel helical structures?",
      "answer": "The anion-exchange strategy, based on asymmetric, shape-matching recognition, allows for the synthesis of novel helical structures by recognizing the anionic copper(ii) complexes with the cationic CB6–sodium(i) 1D coordination polymer.",

    {
      "question": "How do the guest-binding properties of CB6 influence the formation of helical coordination polymers?",

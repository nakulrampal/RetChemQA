      "question": "What is the main goal of metal-organic framework (MOF) research as described in the article?",
      "answer": "The main goal of MOF research is the expansion of pore size and volume.",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What method is introduced in the article to increase MOF porosity and pore size?",
      "answer": "The article introduces the linker labilization method to increase MOF porosity and pore size.",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the two common approaches developed to introduce hierarchical pores into MOFs, as mentioned in the article?",
      "answer": "The two common approaches are perturbation-assisted synthesis and template directed synthesis.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the linker labilization method create hierarchical porous structures in MOFs?",
      "answer": "Linker labilization creates hierarchical porous structures by splitting a pro-labile-linker into two removable monocarboxylates under acidic conditions, which are then removed to create mesopores as crystal defects.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of the robust AZDC linkers in the construction of mixed linker Zr-MOFs?",
      "answer": "The robust AZDC linkers support the framework, while the CBAB can be removed by acid treatment to increase the MOF porosity.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The linker exchange process can be easily monitored by UV-vis spectroscopy due to the distinctive ultraviolet-visible absorption peak of AZDC.",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the effect of acid concentration on the porosity and pore size of hierarchical-pore MOFs?",
      "answer": "The acid concentration affects the porosity and pore size of hierarchical-pore MOFs by creating a large concentration of defects, which forms large mesopores and partially destroys the framework integrity at the same time.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The linker labilization method cannot be applied to MOFs with coordinatively unsaturated metal sites.",
      "answer": "False",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of maintaining single crystallinity in MOFs after linker exchange and labilization?",
      "answer": "Maintaining single crystallinity allows for more precise structure characterization by single crystal X-ray diffraction, which provides direct evidence of structural changes and maximizes structure-property understanding.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The maximum pore size of PCN-160 can be tuned by adjusting the exchange ratio and acid concentration.",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the potential applications of MOFs with hierarchical porous structures created by linker labilization?",
      "answer": "The potential applications include adsorption, separation, and catalysis.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the linker labilization method differ from traditional methods of creating large pores in MOFs?",
      "answer": "Linker labilization differs by initially constructing MOFs with pro-labile linkers and then creating mesopores through the removal of these linkers under acidic conditions, maintaining crystallinity and porosity.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The linker labilization method results in the loss of MOF crystallinity.",
      "answer": "False",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"

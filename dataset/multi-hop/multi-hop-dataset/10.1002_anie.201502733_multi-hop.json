      "question": "Why do Zn-pbdc-7a and Zn-pbdc-8a exhibit higher CO2 uptake compared to IRMOF-1 and its derivatives?",
      "answer": "Zn-pbdc-7a and Zn-pbdc-8a exhibit higher CO2 uptake due to their smaller pore sizes, which result from the incorporation of polymer chains in the frameworks, leading to stronger interactions between CO2 and the polyMOFs.",

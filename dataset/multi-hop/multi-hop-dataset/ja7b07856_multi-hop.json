      "question": "What is the primary advantage of incorporating dithienylethene switches into MOFs, as demonstrated by PSZ-1?",
      "answer": "The primary advantage is the bistability between states, thermal stability, and remarkable resistance to fatigue, allowing for reversible photoswitching with a concomitant shift in host–guest interactions.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does the synthesis of PSZ-1 differ from traditional MOF synthesis?",
      "answer": "PSZ-1 is synthesized via the solvent-assisted linker exchange (SALE) method between ZIF-70 and the imidazolate-based dithienylethene linker, H2L1, which is a unique approach compared to traditional MOF synthesis methods.",

    {
      "question": "What role does UV and visible light play in the functionality of PSZ-1?",
      "answer": "UV light induces the transformation of PSZ-1 to a closed form, which changes its absorption properties and host–guest interactions, while visible light reverses this process, demonstrating the material's photoresponsive behavior.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why was ZIF-70 chosen as the base MOF for the synthesis of PSZ-1?",

    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the BET surface area change in PSZ-1 after photoisomerization cycles?",
      "answer": "The significance of the BET surface area change in PSZ-1 after photoisomerization cycles is that it demonstrates the material's structural stability and reversibility of the photoisomerization process without significant loss of surface area or functionality.",

      "question": "How does the choice of ZIF-70 as a precursor influence the final properties of PSZ-1?",
      "answer": "The choice of ZIF-70 as a precursor influences the final properties of PSZ-1 by providing a suitable framework with large pores that can accommodate the dithienylethene linker, thus enabling the synthesis of a photoresponsive MOF with desired pore characteristics.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },

      "question": "What are the empirical formulas for NOF-1, NOF-2, and NOF-3?",
      "answer": "NOF-1: C6 H4 N6 O4 Zn, NOF-2: C8 H8 N6 O4 Zn, NOF-3: C4 H3 N3 O4 Zn",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What method was used to measure the crystal structures of NOF-1, NOF-2, and NOF-3?",
      "answer": "Single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were used to measure the crystal structures.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the photoreactivity of the ligands 2nIm and mnIm change upon formation of the PCPs NOF-1 and NOF-2?",
      "answer": "The photoreactivity of the ligands 2nIm and mnIm drastically increases upon the formation of the PCPs NOF-1 and NOF-2.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does the spatial segregation of functional components in porous frameworks play in the photoreactivity of NOF-1 and NOF-2?",
      "answer": "The spatial segregation in porous frameworks prevents intermolecular ligand interactions, thus preventing excited-state deactivation and increasing photoreactivity.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the NO release from NOF-1 and NOF-2 thermally activated?",
      "answer": "No, the NO release from NOF-1 and NOF-2 is not thermally activated; it is exclusively through a photochemical process.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of using a two-photon laser for NO release in cell stimulation experiments?",
      "answer": "The use of a two-photon laser allows for precise and localized photoactivation of NOF-1, reducing the risk of photodamaging cells with harmful ultraviolet irradiation while effectively inducing NO release.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Did the presence of NOF-1 in the PDMS layer induce notable cytotoxicity in HEK293 cells?",
      "answer": "No, the presence of NOF-1 in the PDMS layer did not induce any notable cytotoxicity in HEK293 cells.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What was the observed cellular response to NO delivery from photoactivated NOF-1 in HEK293-TRPC5 cells?",
      "answer": "The observed cellular response was a rapid increase in the intracellular calcium ion concentration, indicating that the delivered NO activated the TRPC5 channel on the cell membrane.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the NO release efficiency of NOF-1 compare to other solid-state NO-delivery scaffolds?",
      "answer": "NOF-1 exhibits a higher NO release efficiency (3.4 mmol mg-1) compared to the most efficient controllable solid-state NO-delivery scaffolds reported (1.3 mmol mg-1 for nitrosothiol-modified silica xerogels).",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the NO release from NOF-1 and NOF-2 instantaneous upon photoactivation?",
      "answer": "Yes, the NO release from NOF-1 and NOF-2 is instantaneous upon photoactivation, and the production of NO is immediately interrupted when the irradiation ceases.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"

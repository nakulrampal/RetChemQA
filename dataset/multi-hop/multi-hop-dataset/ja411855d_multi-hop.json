          "context": "The synthesis conditions and results for various palladium-catalyzed cross-couplings of aryl chlorides using NiXantphos as a ligand were detailed. The ligand NiXantphos was shown to be deprotonatable under the reaction conditions, leading to the formation of a heterobimetallic Pd–NiXantphos catalyst system. This system was found to outperform other ligands in deprotonative cross-coupling processes (DCCP) with aryl chlorides, affording a variety of triarylmethane products.",

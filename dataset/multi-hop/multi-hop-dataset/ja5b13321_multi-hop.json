      "question": "What is the general procedure for the preparation of rhodium carbenoids as described in the text?",
      "answer": "The general procedure involves adding a solution of the corresponding diazoalkane compound to a solution of the rhodium precursor under rigorously inert conditions. A vigorous effervescence and color change are observed, indicating the formation of the rhodium carbenoid. Crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction can be obtained by layering the solution with cold toluene and hexane at -20°C.",

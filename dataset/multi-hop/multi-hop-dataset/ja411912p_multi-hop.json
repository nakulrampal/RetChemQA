      "question": "What is the role of copper in the copper-catalyzed amidation of unactivated alkanes?",
      "answer": "Copper plays two roles in the copper-catalyzed amidation of unactivated alkanes: it catalyzes the decomposition of tBuOOtBu to generate tert-butoxy radical, which cleaves the C–H bond of the alkanes, and participates in the events after the turnover-limiting step of C–H activation by tert-butoxy radical to form the N-alkyl product.",

    {
      "question": "How does the selectivity for amidation at secondary over tertiary C–H bonds in alkanes occur in the copper-catalyzed reactions?",
      "answer": "The selectivity for amidation at secondary over tertiary C–H bonds in alkanes occurs because the tertiary radical is too hindered to recombine with phen-ligated Cu(II) amidate and imidate complexes, leading to the decomposition of the tertiary radical.",

      "question": "What experimental evidence supports the intermediacy of a tert-butoxy radical in the copper-catalyzed amidation of alkanes?",
      "answer": "Experimental evidence supporting the intermediacy of a tert-butoxy radical includes the formation of benzophenone from diphenylmethanol under catalytic conditions and the formation of anthracene in the presence of 9,10-dihydroanthracene, indicating the generation of a tert-butoxy radical.",

      "question": "What is the outcome of the stoichiometric reaction of 1-phth2 or 1-phth with cyclohexane in the absence and presence of tBuOOtBu?",
      "answer": "In the absence of tBuOOtBu, no N-alkyl product was observed in the stoichiometric reactions of 1-phth2 or 1-phth with cyclohexane. In the presence of tBuOOtBu, the reactions produced N-cyclohexylphthalimide and other products, indicating that tBuOOtBu is essential for the reaction to proceed.",

    {
      "question": "What does the kinetic isotope effect (KIE) measurement reveal about the turnover-limiting step in the catalytic amidation of cyclohexane?",
      "answer": "The kinetic isotope effect (KIE) measurement reveals that hydrogen atom abstraction of cyclohexane by a tert-butoxy radical is the turnover-limiting step in the catalytic amidation process.",

    {
      "question": "How does the concentration of copper affect the yield of the amidation products in the copper-catalyzed reactions?",
      "answer": "At low concentrations of copper, the rate of amidation increases with increasing concentration of copper. However, at higher concentrations of copper, the yield of the amidation products decreases, possibly due to faster decomposition of peroxide leading to a higher concentration of tert-butoxy radical relative to the concentration of copper complex.",

      "question": "What is the significance of the mass balance experiments conducted with adamantane and trans-1,4-dimethylcyclohexane?",
      "answer": "The mass balance experiments with adamantane and trans-1,4-dimethylcyclohexane provide insight into the fate of all the alkyl radicals that could form, revealing pathways by which tertiary alkyl radicals decompose in the reaction and supporting the selectivity for secondary over tertiary C–H bonds.",

    {
      "question": "What role does the solvent play in the copper-catalyzed amidation reactions, as indicated by the use of 1,2-dichlorobenzene in some experiments?",
      "answer": "The use of 1,2-dichlorobenzene as a solvent in some copper-catalyzed amidation reactions suggests that the choice of solvent can influence the reaction outcome, possibly by affecting the solubility of the reagents or the stability of the intermediates.",

    {
      "question": "Why were different ligands, such as 4,7-dimethoxy-1,10-phenanthroline, used in the copper-catalyzed amidation reactions?",
      "answer": "Different ligands, such as 4,7-dimethoxy-1,10-phenanthroline, were used in the copper-catalyzed amidation reactions to stabilize the copper complexes, potentially affecting the reactivity and selectivity of the catalytic process.",

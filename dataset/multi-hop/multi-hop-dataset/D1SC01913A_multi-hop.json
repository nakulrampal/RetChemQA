      "question": "What are the key factors for achieving chiral transcription from the molecular level to the morphological level in homochiral CPs with neutral chain structures?",
      "answer": "The two key factors are weak interchain interactions to avoid tight and parallel packing of the chains, and slight misalignment of the chains to drive twist growth of the chains.",

    {
      "question": "What role does acetic acid play in the formation of S-2C and R-2C crystals?",
      "answer": "Acetic acid plays a critical role in inhibiting the conformer interconversion of the cyclohexyl rings and promoting crystal formation.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the formation mechanism of superhelices S-1H and R-1H differ from that of superhelices R-, S-Tb(pempH)3$2H2O?",
      "answer": "The formation mechanism of superhelices S-1H and R-1H involves weak vdW interactions and mismatched alignment of chains due to conformer interconversion of cyclohexyl groups, whereas the mechanism for R-, S-Tb(pempH)3$2H2O involves the coexistence of different kinds of chains and the presence of nitrate anions.",

      "question": "True or False: The formation of superhelices S-1H and R-1H is anion independent.",

    {
      "question": "What happens when racemic R/S-cyampH2 ligands are used to react with Tb(OAc)3?",
      "answer": "The resulting nanorods were achiral due to the presence of both R- and S-cyampH2 ligands.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the effect of temperature on the growth of superhelices S-1H?",
      "answer": "Higher temperature reduces the tendency of parallel packing of the chains but enhances the tendency to form superhelices due to the misalignment of the chains and facilitates the growth of superhelices.",

      "type": "reasoning"

      "question": "True or False: The presence of only one kind of neutral chain with extremely weak interchain interactions guarantees the formation of superhelices.",

      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What structural feature is critical for the formation of superhelices in the Tb/cyampH2 system?",
      "answer": "The conformer interconversion of the cyclohexyl groups in S-, R-cyampH2 provides the driving force for twist-growth of the chiral neutral chains due to the mismatch in chain stacking.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The formation of superhelices S-1H and R-1H follows a similar 'chain-twist-growth' mechanism as observed in the Tb/pempH2 system.",

      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What experimental techniques were used to confirm the chemical composition and structure of S-1H and R-1H superhelices?",
      "answer": "Elemental analysis, energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analyses, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), infrared spectra (IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electronic circular dichroism (ECD), and vibrating circular dichroism (VCD) were used.",

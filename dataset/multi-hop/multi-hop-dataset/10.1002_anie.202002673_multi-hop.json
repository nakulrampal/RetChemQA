      "question": "How does the presence of two distinct magnetic sublattices affect the magnetic properties of the cobalt(II) systems?",
      "answer": "The presence of two distinct magnetic sublattices, resulting from unique alternating chain conformations, is key to the low-temperature hard magnet behavior, leading to large coercive fields.",

      "question": "Is three-dimensional ordering a prerequisite for large coercivity in the cobalt(II) systems?",
      "answer": "No, the results demonstrate that three-dimensional ordering is not a prerequisite for large coercivity; the pivotal role is played by the individual cobalt(II)–radical chain orientations.",

    {
      "question": "Can the cobalt(II) systems be permanently magnetized by application of a field?",
      "answer": "True, similar to traditional hard magnets, the cobalt(II) systems can be permanently magnetized by application of a field and will only lose magnetization upon application of an opposing magnetic field of the appropriate strength.",

      "question": "Does the presence of two distinct magnetic sublattices lead to weaker magnetic exchange interactions in the cobalt(II) systems?",
      "answer": "False, the presence of two distinct magnetic sublattices, resulting from unique alternating chain conformations, is critical to the large coercivity and strong magnetic exchange interactions.",

    {
      "question": "Are the cobalt(II) systems considered as alternatives to lanthanide-based hard magnets?",
      "answer": "True, due to their structural and chemical versatility, and the typically mild, bottom-up nature of their synthesis, the cobalt(II) systems are considered as intriguing alternatives to lanthanide-based hard magnets.",

      "question": "Is the magnetic behavior of the discrete cobalt(II)–radical compounds similar to that of the chain compounds?",
      "answer": "False, while the discrete compounds behave as simple paramagnets, the chain compounds exhibit single-chain magnet behavior with substantial energy barriers and large magnetic hysteresis.",

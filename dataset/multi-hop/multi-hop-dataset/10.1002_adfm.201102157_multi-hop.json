      "question": "What is the primary function of Cu − TCA and Eu − TCA as described in the text?",
      "answer": "Cu − TCA and Eu − TCA are developed as MOF-based NO chemosensors for the luminescent detection of nitric oxide (NO).",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the presence of NO affect the luminescence of Cu − TCA?",
      "answer": "The presence of NO causes a significant increase in fluorescence of Cu − TCA due to the reduction of Cu(II) to form a diamagnetic species Cu(I), alleviating quenching caused by paramagnetic metal ions.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What makes Eu − TCA a ratiometric luminescent chemosensor towards NO?",
      "answer": "Eu − TCA exhibits both lanthanide-based emission and triphenylamine emission, with the intensity of emission at 610 nm remaining virtually unchanged upon NO addition, allowing Eu3+ emission to act as an internal standard for determining the concentration of NO.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is Cu − TCA considered highly selective for NO detection?",
      "answer": "Cu − TCA is considered highly selective for NO detection because its fluorescence response is specific for NO over other reactive species present in biological systems, as demonstrated by the lack of detectable responses upon the addition of various other reactive oxygen and nitrogen species.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What challenges does Eu − TCA face for application in biological systems?",
      "answer": "Eu − TCA is very sensitive to water, leading to fluorescence quenching in the presence of water, which limits its application for fluorescence imaging in biological systems.",

    {
      "question": "How does the synthesis method of NCu − TCA differ from that of bulk Cu − TCA?",
      "answer": "NCu − TCA, the nanoparticle form of Cu − TCA, is synthesized by microwave heating of a solution of H3TCA and Cu(NO3)2 in DMF/CH3OH at 100°C for 5 minutes, which is a different method compared to the solvothermal reaction used for bulk Cu − TCA.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What experimental evidence supports the specific interaction between Cu − TCA and NO?",
      "answer": "Experimental evidence includes the significant fluorescence enhancement observed upon NO addition, the lack of response to other reactive species, and EPR and FT-IR spectroscopy confirming the reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I) and the formation of Cu(I)−NO adducts.",

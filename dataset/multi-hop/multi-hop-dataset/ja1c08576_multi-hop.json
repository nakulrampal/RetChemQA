      "question": "How was the mass loading of Zr-MOFs on fiber calculated?",
      "answer": "The mass loading of Zr-MOFs on fiber was calculated based on ICP-OES analysis, using the formula ML = (C x 100 x 0.01 L)/(100 mg x WZr) x 100%, where C is the concentration of Zr in the diluted nitric acid solution measured by ICP-OES in mg/L, WZr is the mass percentage in MOFs, and other factors are constants or measurements from the process.",

      "question": "What was the purpose of using sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3) solution in the anti-SARS-CoV-2 virus test?",
      "answer": "In the anti-SARS-CoV-2 virus test, sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3) solution was used to quench any coextracted active chlorine and neutralize it, ensuring that the observed effects were due to the MOF-cloth's activity and not residual chlorine.",

      "question": "How was the chlorine stability and regenerability of UiO-66-NH-Cl/PET composite tested?",
      "answer": "The chlorine stability and regenerability of UiO-66-NH-Cl/PET composite were tested by evaluating the remaining chlorine after storage under ambient conditions for 40 days, and by assessing the rechargeability through quenching and rechlorination cycles.",

      "question": "What safety precautions were mentioned for handling TFA during the synthesis of MOF coatings on fiber?",
      "answer": "For handling TFA during the synthesis of MOF coatings on fiber, it was mentioned that all research must be conducted in a well-ventilated chemical fume hood with adequate personal protective equipment, including a properly fitting lab coat, long pants, closed-toed footwear, and chemical safety glasses.",

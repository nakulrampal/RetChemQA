      "question": "What is the primary method used for the synthesis of ZIF-67 membranes as described in the text?",
      "answer": "The primary method used for the synthesis of ZIF-67 membranes is heteroepitaxial growth on ZIF-8 seed layers under solvothermal conditions.",

    {
      "question": "How does the presence of methanol in the synthesis solution affect the quality and thickness of ZIF-67 membranes?",
      "answer": "The presence of methanol as a co-solvent in the synthesis solution leads to the reduction in the membrane thickness and enhancement in the reproducibility of ZIF-67 membranes.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the effect of hydrothermal ligand treatment on ZIF-67 layers before the tertiary growth of a ZIF-8 layer?",
      "answer": "Hydrothermal ligand treatment of ZIF-67 layers before the tertiary growth of a ZIF-8 layer stabilizes the performance of ZIF-8/ZIF-67 membranes, likely by healing surface defects and minimizing defect sites at the interface between ZIF-8 and ZIF-67 layers.",

    {
      "question": "Is the performance enhancement and stabilization effect observed with ZIF-8 overlayers specific only to ZIF-8 or also applicable to ZIF-67 overlayers?",
      "answer": "The performance enhancement and stabilization effect is not specific to ZIF-8 overlayers but is also verified by ZIF-67/ZIF-67 membranes, indicating that the effect is applicable to both ZIF-8 and ZIF-67 overlayers.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The synthesis of ZIF-67 membranes without methanol co-solvent results in membranes with higher propylene permeance and separation factors compared to those synthesized with methanol.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of microwave-assisted seeding in the preparation of ZIF-8 seed layers?",
      "answer": "Microwave-assisted seeding enables the rapid formation of densely packed ZIF-8 seed layers that are strongly attached to supports, which is crucial for the successful heteroepitaxial growth of ZIF-67 membranes.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"

    {
      "question": "True or False: ZIF-67 membranes synthesized without a ZIF-8 seed layer exhibit stable propylene/propane separation performances.",

      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What hypothesis is proposed to explain the performance instability of ZIF-8/ZIF-67 membranes during on-stream measurements?",
      "answer": "The hypothesis proposed is that local defects such as under-saturated metal (Co) sites might have been generated during the heteroepitaxial tertiary growth of the ZIF-8 overlayer, and the local structure might have been modified during the measurements, causing performance instability.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"

    {
      "question": "True or False: The addition of a ZIF-8 overlayer on ZIF-67 membranes by tertiary growth does not significantly affect the propylene/propane separation factors.",

      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the synthesis environment (presence of methanol and water) influence the formation of defects in ZIF-67 membranes?",
      "answer": "The synthesis of ZIF-67 membranes in water without methanol co-solvent leads to the formation of visible white spots containing pinhole defects in an uncontrolled manner, indicating that the synthesis environment significantly influences the formation of defects.",

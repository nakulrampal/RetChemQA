    {
      "question": "What is the main purpose of microfluidic pen lithography (MPL) as described in the text?",
      "answer": "The main purpose of MPL is to perform femtolitre chemistry on surfaces by handling and mixing femtolitre volumes of reagents, enabling a broad range of femtolitre reactions in water and organic solvents, and the confined crystallization of nanomaterials at precise locations on surfaces in a spatially ordered and combinatorial manner.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does MPL overcome the limitations of vesicles, micelles, and the costly step of fabricating microdevices and wells?",
      "answer": "MPL overcomes these limitations by allowing the mixing of reagents in isolated femtolitre droplets directly on surfaces, which can be used as reactors for independent reactions and/or crystallization processes, thus obviating the need for fabricating microdevices and wells.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the two main steps involved in the MPL method?",
      "answer": "The two main steps involved in the MPL method are femtolitre droplet generation and femtolitre volume delivery into these droplets.",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: MPL can only be used for liquid reactions and is not suitable for the synthesis and crystallization of materials.",
      "answer": "False",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What types of reactions and processes were successfully demonstrated using MPL?",
      "answer": "MPL was successfully used for acid-base reactions, enzymatic recognition reactions, synthesis and crystallization of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), creation of multiplexed nanoscale MOF arrays, and screening combinatorial reactions for the crystallization of novel peptide-based materials.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does MPL ensure homogeneous mixing and control over the ratio of reagents in the mixture droplets?",
      "answer": "MPL ensures homogeneous mixing and control over the ratio of reagents by using dwell times (DT1 for the first reagent and DT2 for the second reagent) to control the size and volume of the droplets, and by evaluating and minimizing cross-contamination effects between droplets.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The MPL method requires high relative humidity conditions to prevent droplet evaporation during reactions.",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What future enhancements are suggested for MPL to widen its scope and capabilities?",
      "answer": "Future enhancements for MPL include the introduction of microfluidic multi-pens for greater control and versatility, and method development to optimize crucial reaction parameters such as humidity, temperature, surface type, and evaporation rate.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: MPL is limited to the synthesis of materials that do not involve chemical reactions.",
      "answer": "False",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What potential applications are envisioned for MPL as it matures and becomes more sophisticated?",
      "answer": "As MPL matures, it is envisioned to enable high-throughput assays and combinatorial screening, perform femtolitre-scale biological studies, discover novel materials, fabricate arrays of complex structures, and potentially be useful for electronics and sensors.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"

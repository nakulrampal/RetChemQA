      "answer": "The analysis of nearest neighbor spin coupling (J) and critical temperature (Tc) explains the magnetic ordering in [Ru2(O2CMe)4]3[MIII(CN)6] compounds by considering the orbital overlap of the singly occupied molecular orbitals (SOMOs) and the effects of zero-field splitting. The antiferromagnetic coupling between metal ions is expected due to nonorthogonal overlap of orbitals, and the Tc's increase with increasing spin on the metal hexacyanide. However, the increase in Tc's is greater than can be accounted for by mean-field theory without changing the J values, indicating the influence of spin anisotropy and zero-field splitting on magnetic ordering.",

    {
      "question": "What is the impact of the d9-configuration of Cu(II) in DUT-8(Cu) compared to DUT-8 based on Zn, Co, or Ni?",
      "answer": "The d9-configuration of Cu(II) in DUT-8(Cu) leads to a stiffer paddle wheel but weakened Cuâ€“N bond, causing pronounced differences in flexibility compared to DUT-8 based on Zn, Co, or Ni.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the presence of solvent in the pores of DUT-8(Cu) influence its crystal structure?",
      "answer": "The presence of solvent in the pores of DUT-8(Cu) influences the configurations of the paddle wheels, inducing rotation of the linkers and resulting in disorder-switching between monoclinic and tetragonal symmetries.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What effect does the particle size have on the flexibility of DUT-8(Cu) during CO2 adsorption at 195 K?",
      "answer": "The particle size of DUT-8(Cu) influences its flexibility during CO2 adsorption at 195 K, with macro-crystals undergoing a structural 'breathing' transition, while submicron-sized crystals show rigid behavior.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the desolvated open pore phase of DUT-8(Cu) stable under thermal conditions?",
      "answer": "The desolvated open pore phase of DUT-8(Cu) is relatively stable under thermal conditions, but decomposition starts at lower temperatures for smaller particles, indicating that particle size influences thermal stability.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens to DUT-8(Cu) macro-crystals during the first cycle of CO2 adsorption/desorption at 195 K?",
      "answer": "During the first cycle of CO2 adsorption/desorption at 195 K, a part of DUT-8(Cu) macro-crystals undergoes a structural 'breathing' transition, but irreversible structural changes occur upon desorption, leading to the formation of a dense, nonresponsive phase.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The synthesis conditions of DUT-8(Cu) were modified to obtain larger crystals for single-crystal X-ray analysis.",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: Desolvation of DUT-8(Cu) always leads to the formation of a closed pore phase.",
      "answer": "False",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of HCl in the synthesis of DUT-8(Cu) to obtain larger crystals?",
      "answer": "HCl is used as a modulating agent to suppress fast nucleation, allowing for the formation of larger crystals by preventing hyper-saturation in the reaction solution.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the electronic configuration of the metal complex in DUT-8(Cu) affect its phase transition behavior?",
      "answer": "The electronic configuration of the metal complex in DUT-8(Cu) significantly impacts its phase transition behavior, with the d9-configuration of Cu(II) leading to differences in flexibility and the ability to maintain the open pore phase upon desolvation.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The flexibility of DUT-8(Cu) is solely determined by the desolvation process.",
      "answer": "False",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"

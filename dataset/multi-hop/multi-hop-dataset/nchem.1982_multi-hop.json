      "question": "What is the significance of the discovery of gea-MOF-1 in the context of metal–organic frameworks?",
      "answer": "The discovery of gea-MOF-1 is significant because it introduced a (3,18)-connected net as an ideal blueprint for the design of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs). This discovery allowed for the rational design and directed assembly of MOFs with specific, pre-selected network topologies, enhancing the predictability and potential for designing MOFs with desired properties and functionalities.",

    {
      "question": "How does the substitution of dense inorganic clusters with relatively open metal–organic polyhedra (MOPs) in gea-MOF-2 compare to gea-MOF-1?",
      "answer": "In gea-MOF-2, the substitution of dense inorganic clusters with relatively open metal–organic polyhedra (MOPs) results in a MOF with an additional cavity compared to gea-MOF-1, leading to a more open and potentially more functional structure. This substitution demonstrates the effectiveness of using more complex and open MOPs as supermolecular building blocks (SBBs) to access additional functionalized spaces within MOFs.",

    {
      "question": "What role does the SBB approach play in the design of gea-MOFs?",
      "answer": "The SBB approach plays a crucial role in the design of gea-MOFs by facilitating the deliberate construction of MOF structures. It employs more elaborate building units, such as metal–organic polyhedra (MOPs), as highly connected supermolecular building blocks (SBBs). This approach allows for the embedding of hierarchical information and coding for the rational design of MOFs, enabling the substitution of dense clusters with relatively open MOPs to create MOFs with specific topologies and functionalities.",

      "question": "What potential applications were explored for gea-MOF-1?",
      "answer": "Potential applications explored for gea-MOF-1 include gas storage, CO2 capture, hydrocarbon separation, and as a catalyst in the coupling of CO2 and epoxides. Its high thermal stability, accessibility of extended network of exposed metal centres, and high affinity for certain hydrocarbons over others, such as high selectivity for C3H8 and n-C4H10 over CH4, demonstrate its versatility and potential in various environmental and industrial applications.",

    {
      "question": "How does the discovery of a (3,18)-connected MOF followed by the design of a second MOF with a different chemical system validate the rational design of MOFs?",
      "answer": "The discovery of a (3,18)-connected MOF (gea-MOF-1) followed by the design of a second MOF (gea-MOF-2) with a different chemical system validates the rational design of MOFs by demonstrating that it is possible to predict and replicate a specific network topology in different chemical contexts. This process involved using the newly discovered topology as a blueprint and successfully substituting dense inorganic clusters with relatively open metal–organic polyhedra (MOPs), thereby confirming the potential for systematic design and assembly of MOFs with desired properties.",

    {
      "question": "What challenges does the design and directed assembly of MOFs with specific network topologies face?",
      "answer": "The design and directed assembly of MOFs with specific network topologies face challenges such as predicting the network topology prior to synthesis, ensuring the points of extension of the requisite building blocks match the vertices of the corresponding vertex figure in the targeted net, and dealing with highly connected nets where controlling the directionality and structural information in the building blocks is crucial for achieving the desired MOF structure.",

    {
      "question": "What is the impact of the SBB approach on the design of solid-state materials?",
      "answer": "The impact of the SBB approach on the design of solid-state materials is significant as it offers a new perspective on material design by allowing for the systematic substitution of dense clusters with open metal–organic polyhedra (MOPs). This approach enables the embedding of complex information into the building units, facilitating the rational design and construction of MOFs with specific topologies and functionalities. It opens up new possibilities for designing materials with targeted properties by exploring complex nets and their embedded polyhedra or layers.",

      "question": "How does the thermal stability of gea-MOF-1 contribute to its potential applications?",
      "answer": "The thermal stability of gea-MOF-1 contributes to its potential applications by ensuring that it maintains its optimal porosity and structural integrity under high temperatures, up to 360 °C under vacuum. This remarkable thermal stability makes gea-MOF-1 suitable for applications that require durability and stability under thermal stress, such as gas storage, CO2 capture, hydrocarbon separation, and catalysis, where the material's performance and functionality must be preserved over time and under varying conditions.",

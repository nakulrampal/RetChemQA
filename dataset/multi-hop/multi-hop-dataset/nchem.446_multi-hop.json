    },
    {
      "question": "How was the size of the silica nanoparticles controlled in the synthesis process?",
      "answer": "The size of the silica nanoparticles was controlled by expanding the diameter of the sphere using ligands with additional spacers, such as ligand 1c for larger nanoparticles.",

      "question": "What was the significance of the polydispersity (Mw/Mn) value being close to unity for the silica nanoparticles?",
      "answer": "A polydispersity (Mw/Mn) value close to unity indicated that the silica nanoparticles were almost perfectly monodisperse, which is significant for achieving uniform properties and potential applications.",

      "question": "What was the result of the condensation reaction of TMOS in the presence of sphere 2b, which lacks interior glucose units?",
      "answer": "In the presence of sphere 2b, which lacks interior glucose units, the condensation of TMOS proceeded in the bulk solvent, leading to the precipitation of silica gel and indicating that interior polyol coating was necessary for producing silica nanoparticles within the spherical complex.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The degree of silica condensation and the density and surface area of the monodisperse silica nanoparticles could be controlled by tuning the equivalents of TMOS employed.",

      "question": "What are the synthesis conditions for KSrCO3F and RbSrCO3F?",
      "answer": "Single crystals of KSrCO3F were grown from a high temperature solution using K2CO3–SrF2 as a flux, with a molar ratio of K2CO3/SrCO3/SrF2 = 2:1:2, heated at 800 °C until the melt became transparent and clear, then cooled to 700 °C and further to 600 °C. RbSrCO3F crystals were grown under similar conditions but with a molar ratio of Rb2CO3/SrCO3/SrF2 = 1.5:1:1.5.",

      "question": "What method was used to measure the second-harmonic generation (SHG) signals of the synthesized crystals?",
      "answer": "The SHG signals were measured using the Kurtz and Perry technique, which involved grinding and sieving polycrystalline samples into specific particle size ranges, then irradiating them with a pulsed laser at 1064 nm and 532 nm for visible and UV SHG, respectively.",

      "question": "How were the crystal structures of the synthesized materials determined?",
      "answer": "The crystal structures were determined using single crystal X-ray diffraction data collected at room temperature on a Rigaku Mercury CCD diffractometer with graphite-monochromatic Mo Kα radiation.",

      "question": "What was the purpose of using a CO2 atmosphere during the synthesis of certain crystals?",
      "answer": "A CO2 atmosphere was used during the synthesis of KCaCO3F, RbCaCO3F, and CsCaCO3F to provide enough partial CO2 pressure, which is necessary to prevent the decomposition of carbonates at high temperatures and ensure the growth of large crystals.",

      "question": "True or False: All synthesized crystals, except for Cs3Ba4(CO3)3F5, consist of infinite B–F–B chains parallel to the c-axis.",

      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What was the main challenge in obtaining fluoride carbonate crystals by high temperature solid state reaction?",
      "answer": "The main challenge was that carbonates decompose at high temperature, making it difficult to grow single crystals using high temperature solid state reaction.",

    {
      "question": "What was the unique feature of the crystal structure of Cs3Ba4(CO3)3F5 compared to the other synthesized materials?",
      "answer": "The unique feature of Cs3Ba4(CO3)3F5's crystal structure is that it exhibits three different spatial arrangements for the [CO3] triangles, including noncoplanar alignment, which is different from the coplanar and parallel alignment observed in the other synthesized materials.",

    {
      "question": "What role do the countercations play in the alignment of [CO3] groups in the synthesized materials?",
      "answer": "The countercations, which include alkali metals (K, Rb, Cs) and alkaline earth cations (Ca, Sr, Ba), play a crucial role in directing the assembly of the anionic [CO3] groups. Their size and positive charges influence the spatial arrangement of [CO3] groups, leading to different nonlinear optical nonlinearity for each carbonate.",

      "question": "True or False: The synthesized materials are all stable in air and not hydroscopic, making them promising for practical UV NLO applications.",

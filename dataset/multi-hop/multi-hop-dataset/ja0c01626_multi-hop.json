      "question": "What is the chemical formula for the metal-organic framework Fe-HAF-1?",
      "answer": "Fe-HAF-1",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What unique property does Fe-HAF-1 exhibit in terms of charge at a pH above 4?",
      "answer": "Fe-HAF-1 behaves as an ionic MOF and is highly negatively charged above a pH of 4.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the zeta potential measurement for Fe-HAF-1?",
      "answer": "The zeta potential measurement indicates that Fe-HAF-1 becomes highly negatively charged above a pH of 4, which is attributed to the formation of defects during synthesis.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Fe-HAF-1's ability to selectively adsorb positively charged ions in aqueous solution relate to its charge properties?",
      "answer": "Fe-HAF-1's anionic nature, due to being negatively charged above pH 4, enables it to selectively adsorb positively charged ions in aqueous solution, demonstrating its charge selectivity.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: Fe-HAF-1 maintains its crystallinity and cubic morphology after exposure to various chemical conditions.",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What challenges were encountered during the activation of Fe-HAF-1?",
      "answer": "The challenges included the collapse of the structure upon removal of solvents using conventional methods and the inability to fully remove DEF without causing structural collapse.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The BET surface area of Fe-HAF-1 was found to be less than 10 m2 g-1 after various activation attempts.",

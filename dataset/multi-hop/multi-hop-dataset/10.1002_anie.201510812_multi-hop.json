    },
    {
      "question": "Why are cationic frameworks less common compared to anionic or neutral frameworks?",
      "answer": "Cationic frameworks are rarer because of the challenges in preventing the occupation of metal coordination sites by neutralizing ligands such as OH-, which would neutralize the positive charge.",

    {
      "question": "What strategy is proposed for developing positively charged metal-organic frameworks (P-MOFs)?",
      "answer": "The strategy proposed for developing P-MOFs is preemptive coordination (PC), which involves proactively blocking metal coordination sites to prevent their occupation by neutralizing ligands.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the preemptive coordination (PC) concept contribute to the development of P-MOFs?",
      "answer": "The PC concept contributes to the development of P-MOFs by ensuring the high stability, porosity, and anion-exchange capability of these frameworks, allowing for the immobilization of anionic nucleotides and coenzymes.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of the ratio between neutral and negative ligand groups in the overall charge of a cluster?",
      "answer": "The ratio between neutral and negative ligand groups plays a pivotal role in determining the overall charge of a cluster, affecting its ability to form cationic frameworks.",

    {
      "question": "Why is it advantageous to use transition metal ions in the development of P-MOFs?",
      "answer": "It is advantageous to use transition metal ions in the development of P-MOFs because of their desirable properties such as low cost, low toxicity, and high stability in aqueous environments.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the 9-connected framework topology in the development of P-MOFs?",
      "answer": "The 9-connected framework topology is significant because it ensures that all open metal sites of the trimer are occupied with neutral groups, preventing the attachment of neutralizing anions and leading to the formation of P-MOFs.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the use of different ligand combinations affect the properties of P-MOFs?",
      "answer": "The use of different ligand combinations allows for the synthesis of isoreticular structures with varying pore sizes and geometries, essential for applications as selective ion exchangers or separation mediums.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What demonstrates the charge selectivity during ion exchange in P-MOFs?",
      "answer": "The charge selectivity during ion exchange in P-MOFs is demonstrated by the absence of ion-exchange between NO3- and cationic or neutral dyes, while an obvious concentration drop is observed for anionic dyes.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the size selectivity during ion exchange manifest in P-MOFs?",
      "answer": "The size selectivity during ion exchange in P-MOFs is manifested by the different ion-exchange kinetics of five differently sized anionic dyes with the same charge, indicating size-dependent ion exchange.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"

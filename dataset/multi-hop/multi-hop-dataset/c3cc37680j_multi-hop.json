      "question": "What is the role of 2,2'-bipyridine in the synthesis of the manganese-lanthanide frameworks?",
      "answer": "2,2'-bipyridine serves as a secondary ligand providing chelating N-donors to cater for hard–soft acid–base theory in order to achieve one-pot assembly.",

    {
      "question": "How does the luminescence of polymer 3 compare to the other polymers synthesized?",
      "answer": "Polymer 3 exhibits emission peaks at 534, 592, 617, and 690 nm upon excitation at 395 nm, with the most intense emission at 617 nm assigned to the electric-dipole-induced 5D0–7F2 transition, indicating a red emission light, which is distinct from the other polymers.",

      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of using D-camphoric acid in the synthesis of the manganese-lanthanide frameworks?",
      "answer": "D-camphoric acid serves as an enantiopure ditopic organic linker to induce a given handedness, contributing to the homochirality of the frameworks.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the thermal stability sequence of the synthesized polymers based on their thermogravimetric (TG) studies?",
      "answer": "The TG studies show a thermo-stability sequence of 2 > 3 > 1 > 4.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How do the magnetic susceptibility measurements of polymers 1-4 vary with temperature?",
      "answer": "The magnetic susceptibility measurements show that the χmT product decreases continuously as the temperature is lowered, indicating depopulation of the Stark levels.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The luminescent properties of polymers 1-4 are identical.",
      "answer": "False. The luminescent properties vary among the polymers, with distinct emission peaks observed for each.",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What topological structure is observed in the synthesized manganese-lanthanide frameworks when viewed along a certain orientation?",
      "answer": "The overall framework can be represented as a six-connected net with a vertex symbol of 4.4.42.4.4.4.4.42.42.64.64.64.64.64.64, showing a hexagonal 3D topological structure when viewed from the orientation of the a-axis.",

    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The synthesis of the manganese-lanthanide frameworks results in a racemic mixture.",
      "answer": "False. The synthesis results in homochiral frameworks due to the use of enantiopure D-camphoric acid.",

    {
      "question": "What was the effect of bromination on the absorption properties of the MOF?",
      "answer": "Bromination, especially at the surface, prevented the inclusion of N2, CO2, and I2 and slowed down the inclusion and release of H2O, MeOH, and EtOH molecules, indicating that bromination can be used to fine-tune the internal molecular environments of MOFs.",

      "question": "What was the initial form of the MOF before any postsynthetic modifications, and what were its key structural features?",
      "answer": "The initial form of the MOF was {Zn3[(L)2(m2-OH)2]·6 H2O}n, featuring a three-dimensional framework with linear trimeric ZnII secondary building units and channels containing water of crystallization surrounding the uncoordinated hydroxyethyl groups.",

    {
      "question": "How did the researchers confirm the transformation of the hydroxyethyl group to a vinyl group in the MOF?",
      "answer": "The transformation was confirmed through multiple characterizations including PXRD patterns, solid-state 13C NMR spectra, liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC–MS), and 1H NMR spectroscopy, which indicated that the framework remained intact and the carbon backbone of the organic ligand was still present.",

    {
      "question": "What was the role of the hydroxyethyl tag group in the MOF's structure and its significance in postsynthetic modification?",
      "answer": "The hydroxyethyl tag group did not take part in the coordination of the metal atoms but was free for further reactions, making it significant for postsynthetic modifications such as the transformation to a vinyl group and subsequent bromination.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"

    {
      "question": "What was the observed effect on the MOF's photoluminescence properties after dehydration and subsequent modifications?",
      "answer": "After dehydration at 120°C, a major red-shift of the photoluminescence band was observed for 1’, suggesting a decrease of the p–p* transition energy. Further heating at 250°C led to a progressive red-shift, indicating an increase in conjugation due to the transformation of the hydroxyethyl to the vinyl group.",

      "question": "How did the size of the MOF crystals affect the bromination process?",
      "answer": "The size of the MOF crystals affected the bromination process, with smaller crystals showing more brominated ligand observed, indicating that bromination is only at the surface and thus it closes the windows preventing further reaction.",

      "question": "What is the significance of using AgBF4 in the synthesis of mCOF-Ag?",
      "answer": "AgBF4 is used to initiate ligand exchange and provide an additional reversible process for the poly-condensation, which is beneficial for the crystal nucleation process. Its presence influences the quality of the crystals, and its amount needs to be carefully controlled to prevent the formation of Ag particles on the material.",

    {
      "question": "How does the structure of mCOF-Ag enable second harmonic generation (SHG)?",
      "answer": "The structure of mCOF-Ag belongs to the C2 space group, which is non-centrosymmetric. This non-centrosymmetric structure is validated by the observation of second harmonic generation (SHG) at 425 nm when the crystal is excited by a fundamental laser wavelength of 850 nm.",

      "question": "What role do the pendant amine groups play in the transformation of mCOF-Ag to wCOF-Ag?",
      "answer": "The pendant amine groups in mCOF-Ag are spatially well defined and can be linked by bi-functional compounds like glyoxal in a crystalline-state polymerisation process. This 'stitching' of the inter-chain amine groups by the aldehyde molecules leads to the formation of a cross-linked woven network, transforming mCOF-Ag into wCOF-Ag.",

      "question": "True or False: The synthesis of mCOF-Ag involves a one-pot reaction combining self-assembly and imine condensation under solvothermal conditions.",

    {
      "question": "What is the impact of crystalline-state polymerisation on the mechanical properties of wCOF-Ag compared to mCOF-Ag?",
      "answer": "Crystalline-state polymerisation, through 'stitching' of inter-chain amine groups, transforms mCOF-Ag into wCOF-Ag, resulting in a dramatic sixfold enhancement in photoluminescence intensity and a distinct increase in Young's modulus from 9.0 GPa for mCOF-Ag to 19.1 GPa for wCOF-Ag, indicating greater rigidity.",

      "question": "What experimental techniques were used to confirm the single-crystal nature of mCOF-Ag?",
      "answer": "The single-crystal nature of mCOF-Ag was confirmed using single-crystal electron diffraction (SCED), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) techniques.",

    {
      "question": "How does the feeding ratio of I, II, and AgBF4 influence the formation of mCOF-Ag?",
      "answer": "The feeding ratio of I, II, and AgBF4 significantly influences the formation of mCOF-Ag. A carefully controlled ratio is required to prevent the formation of Ag particles on the material and ensure the quality of the crystals. The optimal ratio found for the synthesis was I:II:AgBF4 = 3:1:1.",

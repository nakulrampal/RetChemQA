      "question": "What is the role of linker desymmetrization in the construction of RE-MOFs?",
      "answer": "Linker desymmetrization plays a critical role in constructing RE-MOFs with eight-connected hexanuclear clusters by influencing the size, rigidity, and symmetry of linkers, which allows for the access to traditionally unattainable RE-tetracarboxylate MOFs with specific topologies.",

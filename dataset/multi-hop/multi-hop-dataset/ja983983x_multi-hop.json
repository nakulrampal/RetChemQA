      "question": "What is the significance of the design strategies reported in the article for the development of multichromophoric arrays?",
      "answer": "The design strategies lead to arrays of defined rigidity, dimensionality, porosity, and selectivity, allowing for the insertion of virtually unlimited numbers of metal ions, fine-tuning of light-harvesting systems, sensors, and the accommodation of guest molecules for tuning electronic properties.",

      "question": "How does the synthesis approach of mixing both freebase TPyP and Zn-metalated (ZnTPyP) tetrapyridylporphyrins contribute to the design of solid-state multiporphyrin arrays?",
      "answer": "This approach provides greater control over the introduction of various porphyrin chromophores and their integration in the solid state, allowing for fine-tuning of the metalation and inclusion of functionality into the porphyrin itself, thus offering further control of spectroscopic properties.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What challenges are associated with the synthesis of completely metallated analogues of complexes 1 and 4-6 using ZnTPyP?",
      "answer": "The synthesis is limited because the preferential coordination of the TPyP to Zn2+ in the porphyrin cavity interferes with the formation of the 1D structures observed in complexes 1 and 4-6, leading to a change in structure due to intermolecular MTPyP coordination.",

    {
      "question": "What role do the TCE molecules play in the crystal structures of complexes 1-6, and how does their inclusion vary?",
      "answer": "TCE molecules are sandwiched between layers, capping supramolecular cavities or being intercalated, with their inclusion varying by adjusting stacking features without modifying the overall framework, demonstrating an ability to include variable numbers of identical neutral guest molecules.",

      "type": "factual"

      "question": "Based on the article, what potential applications can be derived from the ability to control the interlayer separations of 2D layers or the host−guest properties of the networks in complexes 1-6?",
      "answer": "This property may be exploited to control electronic properties, design sensors and optical switches, and for sensing applications by exchanging solvent molecules with suitable quenchers.",

      "question": "How does the strategy of crystallizing metal halides and TPyP in the presence of suitable metal salts contribute to the synthesis of ordered multiporphyrinic supramolecular arrays?",
      "answer": "This strategy allows for the selective population of porphyrin cavities with various metal cations without distorting the coordination networks, enabling the synthesis of controllable and predictable porphyrinic multichromophores in the solid state.",

      "question": "How does the inclusion of TCE molecules in the crystal lattices of complexes 1-6 demonstrate the ability to control solvent inclusion?",
      "answer": "The inclusion of TCE molecules varies by adjusting their stacking features without modifying the overall framework, demonstrating an ability to include variable numbers of identical neutral guest molecules by subtle rearrangement of the stacking of layers.",

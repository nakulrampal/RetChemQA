    },
    {
      "question": "What factors contribute to the porosity of SCIF-3?",
      "answer": "The porosity of SCIF-3 is contributed by the longer and less negative imidazolate ligands, which require fewer protonated template molecules to balance the charge of the SCIF framework.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why was DBU unique in the synthesis of SCIFs?",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does the synthesis of SCIFs represent a significant advance in metal chalcogenide chemistry?",
      "answer": "The synthesis of SCIFs represents a significant advance by demonstrating the feasibility of using organic ligands to covalently assemble larger supertetrahedral clusters into higher dimensions (3D), and by integrating chemistry between metal chalcogenides and zeolitic imidazolates.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the relationship between the size of supertetrahedral clusters and the band gaps of SCIFs?",
      "answer": "The band gaps of SCIFs are influenced by the size of the supertetrahedral clusters, with T3-containing SCIFs having higher band gaps compared to T4-containing SCIFs.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the choice of imidazolate ligands affect the structural properties of SCIFs?",
      "answer": "The choice of imidazolate ligands affects the structural properties of SCIFs by influencing the degree of interpenetration and the space-group symmetries, which in turn affects their channel geometries and semiconducting properties.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does SCIF-3 exhibit significant CO2 uptake capacity?",
      "answer": "SCIF-3 exhibits significant CO2 uptake capacity due to its permanent porosity, which is enhanced by the longer and less negative imidazolate ligands, and its high symmetry and small substituent that contribute to a lower degree of interpenetration.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the synthesis approach of SCIFs differ from previous methods for assembling chalcogenide clusters?",
      "answer": "The synthesis approach of SCIFs differs by using anionic organic ligands (imidazolates) for cross-linking supertetrahedral chalcogenide clusters, enabling the formation of 3D covalent inorganic–organic superlattices, a departure from previous methods that resulted in lower-dimensional structures.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does the symmetry of SCIFs play in their semiconducting properties?",
      "answer": "The symmetry of SCIFs plays a role in their semiconducting properties by affecting the p–p interactions between sulfur atoms and imidazolate rings, where higher symmetry leads to a smaller band gap due to more parallel aligned p–p systems.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the presence of DBU influence the formation of SCIFs?",
      "answer": "The presence of DBU influences the formation of SCIFs by acting as a unique template that enables the assembly of supertetrahedral clusters and imidazolate ligands into 3D covalent arrays, a process not achieved with other amines.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the assembly of SCIFs solely dependent on the use of imidazole and its derivatives?",
      "answer": "No, the assembly of SCIFs is not solely dependent on the use of imidazole and its derivatives; it also requires a suitable balance among various factors including the choice of metal and sulfide sources, the template amine (DBU), and the specific roles of extra-framework charge-balancing and pore-filling species.",

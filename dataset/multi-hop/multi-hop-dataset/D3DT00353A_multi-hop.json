      "question": "What are the two main types of proton conduction mechanisms mentioned, and what distinguishes them in terms of activation energy?",
      "answer": "The two main types of proton conduction mechanisms are the vehicle mechanism and the Grotthuss mechanism. The vehicle mechanism depends on the direct diffusion between the proton species particles if Ea is larger than 0.4 eV, while the Grotthuss mechanism relies on the hydrogen bonding and 'hopping' between molecules of adjacent proton species if Ea is lower than 0.4 eV.",

    {
      "question": "How does the electrochemical sensing performance of Cd-MOF improve when combined with carbon nanotubes?",
      "answer": "The electrochemical sensing performance of Cd-MOF improves when combined with carbon nanotubes due to the excellent electric conduction of the CNTs, which leads to a significant reduction in the electrochemical impedance and enhances the proton conductivity greatly.",

    {
      "question": "What is the role of the activation energy (Ea) in determining the proton conduction mechanism in Cd-MOF and Cd-MOF@CNTs?",
      "answer": "The activation energy (Ea) plays a crucial role in determining the proton conduction mechanism in Cd-MOF and Cd-MOF@CNTs. If Ea is lower than 0.4 eV, the proton transport mainly relies on the Grotthuss mechanism, which involves 'hopping' between molecules of adjacent proton species through a hydrogen-bonded network.",

    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the activation energy being less than 0.4 eV for proton transfer in Cd-MOF and Cd-MOF@CNTs?",
      "answer": "The significance of the activation energy being less than 0.4 eV for proton transfer in Cd-MOF and Cd-MOF@CNTs is that it indicates the proton transport is mainly through the Grotthuss mechanism, which is more efficient for proton migration due to the hydrogen-bonded network facilitating 'hopping' between adjacent proton species.",

    {
      "question": "How does the introduction of carbon nanotubes affect the activation energy for proton transfer in Cd-MOF composites?",
      "answer": "The introduction of carbon nanotubes into Cd-MOF composites lowers the activation energy for proton transfer, leading to more temperature-insensitive proton conductivity and greatly improved proton conduction performance.",

    {
      "question": "How does the pore size of UBUs in SNNU-45 affect its gas separation performance?",
      "answer": "The pore size of UBUs in SNNU-45, being ultramicroporous, promotes the C2H2/CO2 separation by providing a perfect confined space for selective uptake of C2H2 molecule from C2H2/CO2 mixtures, contributing to its high selectivity.",

    },
    {
      "question": "Why does SNNU-45 exhibit higher C2H2 adsorption capacity compared to CO2?",
      "answer": "SNNU-45 exhibits higher C2H2 adsorption capacity compared to CO2 due to the alignment of open Co sites and uncoordinated carboxylate O donor sites in UBUs that provide strong binding affinity toward C2H2 through hydrogen bonding, making it less ideal for CO2 molecules.",
      "difficulty": "Hard",
      "type": "Reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the temperature affect the C2H2 adsorption capacity of SNNU-45?",
      "answer": "The C2H2 adsorption capacity of SNNU-45 increases with decreasing temperature due to the exothermic nature of physical adsorption, leading to higher uptake capacities at lower temperatures.",

    {
      "question": "What role do the packing pores between UBUs play in the performance of SNNU-45?",
      "answer": "The packing pores between UBUs in SNNU-45 contribute to its high C2H2 storage capacity by providing additional space for gas uptake, complementing the selectivity provided by the ultramicroporous UBUs.",

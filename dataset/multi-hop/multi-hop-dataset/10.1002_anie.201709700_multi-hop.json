    {
      "question": "What structural feature makes the [SnBi3]5- unit analogous to the carbonate ion?",
      "answer": "The [SnBi3]5- unit is iso(valence)electronic with and structurally analogous to the carbonate ion, comprising exclusively metal atoms.",

      "question": "How does the bond length between Sn and Bi in the [SnBi3]5- anion compare to other compounds with covalent Sn-Bi bonds?",
      "answer": "The Sn-Bi distances in the [SnBi3]5- anion are relatively short, indicating a bond order higher than one, which suggests a partial double bond character.",

    },
    {
      "question": "Why is the [SnBi3]5- anion considered a carbonate analogue?",
      "answer": "The [SnBi3]5- anion is considered a carbonate analogue because it is iso(valence)electronic and structurally analogous to the carbonate ion, but consists exclusively of metal atoms.",

      "question": "Does the [SnBi3]5- anion exhibit single or multiple Sn-Bi bond character?",
      "answer": "True, the [SnBi3]5- anion exhibits partial double bond character between Sn and Bi, indicating multiple bond character.",

      "question": "Are the Sn-Bi bond lengths in the [SnBi3]5- anion longer than in other compounds with covalent Sn-Bi bonds?",
      "answer": "False, the Sn-Bi bond lengths in the [SnBi3]5- anion are relatively short, indicating a bond order higher than one.",

    {
      "question": "Can the [SnBi3]5- anion be synthesized without using liquid ammonia as the solvent?",
      "answer": "False, the synthesis of the [SnBi3]5- anion specifically requires liquid ammonia as the solvent.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "True or False"

    {
      "question": "Is the [SnBi3]5- anion formed exclusively in the presence of K4Sn9?",
      "answer": "False, the [SnBi3]5- anion can be formed in the presence of either K4Sn9 or K12Sn17.",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"

    {
      "question": "Does the [SnBi3]5- anion retain the original structural motifs of bismuthides?",
      "answer": "False, reactions of bismuthides with organometallic compounds led to a variety of heteroatomic clusters that do not necessarily retain the original structural motifs of the bismuthides.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "True or False"

      "question": "Is the [SnBi3]5- anion's formation a result of a direct route from elemental Bi?",
      "answer": "False, the [SnBi3]5- anion is not obtained via a direct route from elemental Bi but from the reaction of bismuthides with low-valent tin anions in liquid ammonia.",

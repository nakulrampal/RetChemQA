    },
    {
      "question": "How does the study demonstrate the completion of the carbonylation cycle for CH3Br?",
      "answer": "By exposing dried crystals of the intermediate to CO gas, which promoted the reductive elimination of BrCOMe, transforming the intermediate to a square-planar RhI complex.",

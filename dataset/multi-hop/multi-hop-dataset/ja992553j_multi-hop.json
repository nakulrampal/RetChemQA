      "question": "What is the significance of fluorinated rings in the synthesis of clathrate complexes?",
      "answer": "Fluorinated rings play an important role by favoring 'hetero-recognition' over 'self-recognition', thus enabling the efficient enclathration of larger aromatic guests.",

    {
      "question": "What is the relationship between the flexibility of ligand frameworks and the structure of clathrate complexes?",
      "answer": "The flexibility of the ligand frameworks allows the network topologies to be induced-fit by guest molecules, resulting in 1D, 2D, and 3D structures with large cavities.",

    },
    {
      "question": "Why were fluorinated ligands chosen for the development of flexible coordination networks?",
      "answer": "Fluorinated ligands were chosen because of the very weak intermolecular forces among fluorinated compounds, which prevent the networks from being constricted or interpenetrated, favoring interaction with guest molecules instead.",

      "question": "How does the presence of guest molecules influence the formation of clathrate complexes?",
      "answer": "The presence of guest molecules influences the formation of clathrate complexes by inducing the fit of the network topologies, which adapt to accommodate the guest molecules.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What was the outcome of using a nonfluorinated ligand compared to fluorinated ligands in the synthesis of clathrate complexes?",
      "answer": "Using a nonfluorinated ligand resulted in unsuccessful enclathration of guest molecules and the formation of interpenetrated structures, unlike the successful enclathration achieved with fluorinated ligands.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How do the structural differences of guest molecules affect the network topologies in clathrate complexes?",
      "answer": "Small structural differences in guest molecules lead to significant changes in the network topologies of the host framework, demonstrating the adaptability of the network to various guests.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What role does the stoichiometry play in the synthesis of clathrate complexes from Cd(NO3)2 and fluorinated ligands?",
      "answer": "The 1:2 stoichiometry between Cd(NO3)2 and fluorinated ligands is crucial for the successful synthesis of clathrate complexes, as it ensures the proper formation of the network and enclathration of guest molecules.",

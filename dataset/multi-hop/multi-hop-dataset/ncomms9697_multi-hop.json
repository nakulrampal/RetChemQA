      "question": "What is the primary purpose of synthesizing [Zn(batz)] * 0.5H2O (MAF-49 * H2O)?",
      "answer": "The primary purpose of synthesizing [Zn(batz)] * 0.5H2O (MAF-49 * H2O) is to create a metal-organic framework (MOF) that can efficiently purify ethene by trapping ethane, thereby facilitating the separation of ethene from ethane in gas mixtures.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does MAF-49 achieve high selectivity in separating ethene from ethane?",
      "answer": "MAF-49 achieves high selectivity in separating ethene from ethane through the proper positioning of multiple electronegative and electropositive functional groups on its ultramicroporous pore surface, which form multiple C–H···N hydrogen bonds with ethane instead of the more polar ethene.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: MAF-49 is capable of producing ethene with a purity of 99.95%+ directly from a cracked gas mixture containing a 15:1 ratio of ethene to ethane.",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role do the electronegative nitrogen atoms and electropositive methylene groups play in the selectivity of MAF-49 for ethane over ethene?",
      "answer": "The electronegative nitrogen atoms and electropositive methylene groups in MAF-49 play a crucial role in its selectivity for ethane over ethene by allowing multiple attractive interactions for ethane and enforcing ethene to adopt a position that can only form fewer and weaker attractive interactions.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What experimental techniques were used to confirm the simulation results and visualize the interactions between MAF-49 and the gases?",
      "answer": "Single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) analyses were used to confirm the simulation results and directly visualize the interactions between MAF-49 and the gases.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: MAF-49 shows higher C2H6/C2H4 selectivity compared to other metal-organic frameworks like MAF-3, MAF-4, and IRMOF-8.",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the C2H6 adsorption enthalpy for MAF-49 compared to other gases like C2H4, CO2, and CH4?",
      "answer": "The significance of the C2H6 adsorption enthalpy for MAF-49, being significantly higher than for other gases like C2H4, CO2, and CH4, indicates MAF-49's strong binding and selectivity for C2H6, facilitating efficient separation of C2H6 from these gases.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the structure of MAF-49 change upon loading with gases like C2H6, C2H4, and CO2?",
      "answer": "Upon loading with gases like C2H6, C2H4, and CO2, the structure of MAF-49 changes slightly, with minor shrinkage observed for C2H6 and C2H4, and a relatively large expansion for CO2, indicating different host-guest interactions and steric effects.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The productivity of MAF-49 in producing high-purity ethene from a 15:1 ethene to ethane mixture is significantly higher than that of other MOFs like IRMOF-8.",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What challenges does MAF-49 address in the separation of ethene from ethane compared to traditional methods?",
      "answer": "MAF-49 addresses the challenges of high energy consumption and the need for multiple adsorption-desorption cycles in traditional methods by offering a metal-organic framework capable of directly producing high-purity ethene from ethene-ethane mixtures through selective ethane adsorption at ambient conditions.",

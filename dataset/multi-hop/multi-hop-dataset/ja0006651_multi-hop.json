      "question": "What are the synthesis conditions for 4-Bromo-2,6-dimethyl-benzonitrile (2)?",
      "answer": "A suspension of 4-bromo-2,6-dimethyl-aniline 1 (10.0 g, 0.05 mmol) in 13 mL of HCl (12 M) and 5 mL of H2O was stirred and heated to 90−95 °C in a round-bottom flask for 1.5 h. The mixture was then cooled to 0−5 °C with an ice−water cold bath. A solution of sodium nitrite (3.75 g, 0.054 mmol) in H2O (15 mL), previously cooled to 0−5 °C, was added dropwise to the reaction mixture. Stirring was continued for 30 min after the addition of sodium nitrite. When the presence of free nitrous acid was confirmed (starch−KI paper), the diazonium salt mixture was carefully neutralized with sodium carbonate and then transferred to an ice-jacketed addition funnel.",

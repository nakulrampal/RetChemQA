    },
    {
      "question": "How does the adsorption capacity of Mg-CUK-1 for pyridine compare to larger aromatic molecules?",
      "answer": "The adsorption capacity for pyridine is higher because it can pack more efficiently and engage in host–guest H-bonding interactions, while larger aromatic molecules occupy 72–89% of the total space.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of the pseudo-ice phase formed by H2O molecules inside Mg-CUK-1 channels?",
      "answer": "The pseudo-ice phase, formed by well-ordered H2O molecules through H-bonding interactions, contributes to the lower symmetry of Mg-CUK-1 and affects its channel topology.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the space group change from P21/c to C2/c upon dehydration of Mg-CUK-1?",
      "answer": "The change in space group from P21/c to C2/c upon dehydration indicates a structural transformation that involves a concertina distortion, affecting the channel structure and potentially influencing adsorption behavior.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the adsorption selectivity for p-DVB in Mg-CUK-1 change over time?",
      "answer": "The adsorption selectivity for p-DVB in Mg-CUK-1 increases over time, starting with a selectivity factor of 8.2 and reaching up to 15.0 after 7 days.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the effect of replacing CoII with MgII in the synthesis of CUK-1?",
      "answer": "Replacing CoII with MgII results in a Mg-CUK-1 that is lighter, thermally and chemically more stable, and more environmentally friendly due to MgII's higher hardness and lower toxicity.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does Mg-CUK-1 show a preference for adsorbing p-xylene over o- and m-xylene?",
      "answer": "Mg-CUK-1 prefers p-xylene due to its smaller critical diameter, which allows for easier access to the channels, and the favorable guest–guest interactions that occur with p-xylene's linear packing within the channels.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the microwave synthesis method affect the properties of Mg-CUK-1 compared to conventional heating?",
      "answer": "Microwave synthesis results in smaller crystallites with more accessible pore openings and higher total sorption capacities and CO2 BET surface area compared to conventional heating.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is Mg-CUK-1 able to selectively adsorb p-DVB from a mixture containing m-DVB and other isomers?",
      "answer": "Mg-CUK-1 selectively adsorbs p-DVB due to the planar structure of p-DVB, which enters the channels more easily, and the favorable host–guest and guest–guest stacking forces that stabilize the p-isomer-loaded structure.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does the extended resonance and planar structure of p-DVB play in its selective adsorption by Mg-CUK-1?",
      "answer": "The extended resonance and planar structure of p-DVB facilitate its rapid adsorption into the channels of Mg-CUK-1, as these features allow p-DVB to more easily enter and pack efficiently within the channels.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the dehydration process affect the structural integrity and adsorption behavior of Mg-CUK-1?",
      "answer": "Dehydration causes a concertina distortion in Mg-CUK-1, altering its channel structure, which affects its adsorption behavior by potentially enhancing the selectivity and capacity for certain molecules.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Mg-CUK-1 is thermally stable up to 500 88C.",

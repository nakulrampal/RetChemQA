      "question": "What are the synthesis conditions for ZIF-8 and ZIF-11?",
      "answer": "ZIF-8 was synthesized by combining zinc nitrate tetrahydrate Zn(NO3)2·4H2O and 2-methylimidazole (H-MeIM) in DMF, heated at 140°C for 24 hours. ZIF-11 was synthesized by combining zinc nitrate tetrahydrate Zn(NO3)2·4H2O and benzimidazole (H-PhIM) in DEF, heated at 100°C for 4 days.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the key features observed in the gas sorption isotherms of ZIF-8?",
      "answer": "The gas sorption isotherms of ZIF-8 exhibit Type I behavior, indicating its microporous nature. Two consecutive uptake steps in the micropore region were observed for both nitrogen at 77K and argon at 87K, attributed to a reorganization of the adsorbed gas molecules at certain threshold pressures.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the thermal stability of ZIF-8 compare to that of ZIF-11 based on TGA analysis?",
      "answer": "Based on TGA analysis, ZIF-8 shows a gradual weight-loss step up to 450°C, indicating partial loss of guest species and high thermal stability. ZIF-11 shows a sharp weight-loss step up to 250°C, corresponding to the escape of all DEF solvent molecules, indicating its high thermal stability as well. Both ZIF-8 and ZIF-11 demonstrate high thermal stability up to 550°C in N2 atmosphere.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the structure of ZIF-8 maintained after exposure to boiling water?",
      "answer": "Yes, the structure of ZIF-8 is maintained after exposure to boiling water for 7 days, as evidenced by unchanged PXRD patterns.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "How long did the solvothermal process for synthesizing ZIFs take?",
      "answer": "The solvothermal process for synthesizing ZIFs took from 48 to 96 hours.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What evidence supports the dynamic nature of ZIF-11's structure?",
      "answer": "The evidence supporting the dynamic nature of ZIF-11's structure includes its ability to release DEF solvent molecules trapped in the pores despite the solvent being larger than the aperture size, and the transformation of ZIF-11 to another crystalline material after exposure to boiling water for 3 days.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can ZIF-11 maintain its structure in boiling benzene?",
      "answer": "Yes, ZIF-11 can maintain its structure in boiling benzene for 7 days, as evidenced by unchanged PXRD patterns.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the two-step features in the gas sorption isotherms of ZIF-8?",
      "answer": "The two-step features in the gas sorption isotherms of ZIF-8 are significant because they indicate a reorganization of adsorbed gas molecules at certain threshold pressures, which is attributed to the microporous nature of ZIF-8 and its aperture size being very close to the sizes of nitrogen and argon molecules.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the chemical stability of ZIF-8 in methanol compare to its stability in water?",
      "answer": "ZIF-8 demonstrates high chemical stability in both methanol and water, maintaining its structure after exposure to these solvents at room temperature, 50°C, and their boiling points for 7 days.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What temperature range was used for the solvothermal synthesis of ZIFs?",
      "answer": "The solvothermal synthesis was carried out at temperatures ranging from 85-150°C.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the porosity of MOFs derived from CO2 comparable to those derived from other sources?",
      "answer": "Yes, the porosity of MOFs derived from CO2, as indicated by their BET surface areas, is comparable to, and in some cases exceeds, those of MOFs derived from other sources.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What challenges are associated with the direct use of atmospheric CO2 in chemical synthesis?",
      "answer": "Challenges include the low concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere (400 ppm) requiring efficient capture and conversion methods, and the need for catalysts or conditions that can activate the inert CO2 molecule.",

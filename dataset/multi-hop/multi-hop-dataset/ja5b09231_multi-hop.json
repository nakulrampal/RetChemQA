      "question": "At what temperature and pressure was the crystal structure of [Co3(OH)2btca2] ∙ 2 DMF first characterized?",
      "answer": "The crystal structure was first characterized at room temperature (296 K) and ambient pressure.",

      "question": "What changes occur in the crystal structure of [Co3(OH)2btca2] ∙ 2 DMF upon cooling below 200 K?",
      "answer": "Upon cooling below 200 K, the framework promotes the additional coordination of one DMF to one Co2 per formula unit, resulting in a large rearrangement of the Co stereochemistry and a transition to a low-temperature phase with space group P-1.",

    {
      "question": "How does the application of pressure in a nonpenetrating PTM affect the crystal structure of [Co3(OH)2btca2]∙2 DMF?",
      "answer": "Applying pressure in a nonpenetrating PTM causes a similar reaction to low temperature, where extra-framework DMF molecules coordinate to part of the penta-coordinated Co atoms of the framework, leading to a phase with space group P-1.",

      "question": "What is the effect of soaking [Co3(OH)2btca2]∙2 DMF powder in methanol at ambient conditions?",
      "answer": "Soaking [Co3(OH)2btca2]∙2 DMF powder in methanol at ambient conditions leads to the selective uptake of MeOH, replacing DMF without modifying the structure of the framework.",

    {
      "question": "Describe the stepwise nucleophilic addition observed when [Co3(OH)2btca2]∙2 DMF is replaced by methanol under high pressure.",
      "answer": "Under high pressure, when DMF is replaced by methanol, a two-step nucleophilic addition occurs. Initially, only half of the Co centers coordinate with MeOH, reducing the crystal symmetry. Further compression leads to the saturation of the remaining penta-coordinated Co, restoring the monoclinic symmetry.",

    {
      "question": "True or False: The crystal structure of [Co3(OH)2btca2]∙2 DMF remains unchanged upon soaking in ethanol at ambient conditions.",
      "answer": "False. The P-XRD pattern changes when [Co3(OH)2btca2]∙2 DMF powder is treated with ethanol, indicating that EtOH can also be absorbed in the absence of MeOH.",

      "question": "True or False: The guest exchange process in [Co3(OH)2btca2]∙2 DMF with MeOH is reversible under high pressure.",
      "answer": "True. The guest exchange process in [Co3(OH)2btca2]∙2 DMF with MeOH is reversible under high pressure, as confirmed by XRD measures performed on single crystals and powders during decompression.",

      "question": "What is the significance of the PLATON/SQUEEZE results in estimating the guest content in [Co3(OH)2btca2]∙x MeOH under high pressure?",
      "answer": "The PLATON/SQUEEZE results are significant as they provide an estimation of the guest content in [Co3(OH)2btca2]∙x MeOH under high pressure, which is crucial for understanding the material's sorption properties and structural flexibility.",

      "question": "True or False: The flexibility of the [Co3(OH)2btca2] framework and its sorption-desorption properties are altered by the solvent exchange capacity.",

      "question": "What are the synthesis conditions for UCFMOF-2 and UCFMOF-3?",
      "answer": "UCFMOF-2 is synthesized via a solvothermal reaction of a molecular titanium precursor Ti8O8(tBuCO2)16 with H2BPDC in N,N-diethylformamide (DEF) in a microwave reactor at 120 °C for 1 hour. UCFMOF-3 is synthesized through a solvothermal reaction with H2TPDC in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) in an isothermal oven at 150 °C for 4 days.",

      "question": "What is the impact of including methyl groups in the central rings of TPDC and QPDC on the solubility and photocatalytic performance of the resulting MOFs?",
      "answer": "Including methyl groups in the central rings of TPDC and QPDC favors solubility. Combined with using mildly reactive titanium sources such as Ti8O8(tBuCO2)16, it produces samples that display the highest performance for photocatalysis.",

      "question": "How does the pore size and amine EDG functionalization affect the photocatalytic activity of UCFMOFs?",
      "answer": "Longer links and increased EDG functionalization in UCFMOFs exhibit impressive photocatalytic rates, outperforming MIL-125 by almost 20-fold. This indicates that both pore size and electronic functionalization are important parameters to consider when designing new MOF photocatalysts.",

      "question": "What is the formula for the multivariate series UCFMTV-3-x% and UCFMTV-4-x%, and up to what mol% content of the diamino links DATP and DAQP can crystal formation be observed?",
      "answer": "The formula for the multivariate series is UCFMTV-3-x% and UCFMTV-4-x%, where x indicates the mol% content of the diamino links DATP and DAQP, respectively. Crystal formation can be observed up to 40 mol% DATP/DAQP content.",

    {
      "question": "What are the observed effects of increasing amine content on the HOMO–LUMO gaps and photocatalytic activity of UCFMTVs?",
      "answer": "Increasing amine content results in a decrease of the HOMO–LUMO gaps from Eg = 3.46 eV in UCFMTV-3-0% to 1.80 eV in UCFMTV-3-40% and from Eg = 3.57 eV in UCFMTV-4-0% to 1.93 eV in UCFMTV-4-40%. This decrease in energy gaps is associated with enhanced photocatalytic activity, demonstrating the importance of electronic structure in photocatalytic performance.",

      "question": "How does the BET surface area change with increasing DAQP content in UCFMTV-4?",
      "answer": "For UCFMTV-4, increasing DAQP content results in a decrease in the BET surface area from 2430 m2 g–1 for UCFMTV-4-0% to 1320 m2 g–1 for UCFMTV-4-30%. This decrease is attributed to increased deadweight and dead volume from the −NH2 functional groups.",

      "question": "What is the relationship between substrate uptake and reaction kinetics in UCFMTVs and MIL-125?",
      "answer": "The relationship between substrate uptake and reaction kinetics in UCFMTVs and MIL-125 is observed through adsorption kinetics plots. UCFMOF-3, UCFMOF-4, and MIL-125 show sharp uptakes at early times followed by saturation, while UCFMTV-4-30% shows uptake well below saturation after 24 hours, indicating differences in adsorption related to the diffusion mechanisms and pore apertures.",

      "question": "What are the thermal and structural stabilities of UCFMOFs under photocatalytic conditions?",
      "answer": "All MOFs in the library are thermally stable up to 450 °C under N2 flow and retain their bulk crystallinity after 48 hours under photocatalytic conditions. They also display remarkable shelf-life and postcatalytic stability, retaining bulk crystallinity beyond eight months of benchtop storage without extra precautions.",

    {
      "question": "What does the presence of paramagnetic signals in the ESR spectra of UCFMTV-4-0% and UCFMTV-4-30% indicate about charge-separated states?",
      "answer": "The presence of paramagnetic signals consistent with spin 1/2 at 338 mT (g = 2.00) in both MOFs, with a significantly larger intensity in UCFMTV-4-30%, indicates that 30% functionalization with amino groups produces a larger population of observable charge-separated states, which are crucial for photocatalytic activity.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does the excited-state carrier lifetime in UCFMTV-4-30% compare to UCFMOF-4, and what does this suggest about photocatalytic efficiency?",
      "answer": "The excited-state carrier lifetimes in UCFMTV-4-30% show an overall increase compared to UCFMOF-4. This lifetime enhancement is attributed to the electron density provided by the amine groups, which is thought to stabilize the electron–hole pairs and prolong recombination, suggesting improved photocatalytic efficiency in UCFMTV-4-30%.",

      "question": "What is the significance of the CO2/CH4 selectivity achieved by Co(bdp) in gas separation applications?",
      "answer": "The high CO2/CH4 selectivity achieved by Co(bdp) is significant for gas separation applications because it demonstrates the material's ability to preferentially adsorb CO2 over CH4, which is crucial for processes like natural gas purification where CO2 needs to be removed efficiently.",

    {
      "question": "How does the structure of Co(bdp) change upon exposure to CO2 and what is the impact on its gas adsorption properties?",
      "answer": "Upon exposure to CO2, Co(bdp) undergoes a reversible structural phase change, expanding to form a CO2 clathrate. This structural flexibility leads to high CO2 adsorption capacity and selectivity, particularly under conditions where CO2 and CH4 are present in a mixture.",
      "difficulty": "hard",

    {
      "question": "How does the temperature affect the CO2-induced phase change pressure in Co(bdp) and its implications for gas separation?",
      "answer": "The CO2-induced phase change pressure in Co(bdp) is strongly dependent on temperature, with minor changes in temperature having a dramatic effect on the step pressure. This allows for the tailoring of the material's adsorption properties to specific separation conditions by adjusting the temperature.",

      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does the linker functionalization play in controlling the adsorption properties of Co(bdp)?",
      "answer": "Linker functionalization, such as fluorination, plays a crucial role in controlling the adsorption properties of Co(bdp) by affecting the phase change pressures. This allows for synthetic control over the material's adsorption and separation properties, making it customizable for specific applications.",
      "difficulty": "medium",

    {
      "question": "Explain how the breakthrough experiments complement the powder X-ray diffraction findings in understanding Co(bdp)'s gas separation performance.",
      "answer": "Breakthrough experiments complement powder X-ray diffraction findings by providing dynamic adsorption data, showing how Co(bdp) selectively adsorbs gases over time under flow conditions. This helps validate the structural changes observed in diffraction studies and their impact on gas separation performance.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What challenges are associated with conducting breakthrough experiments with Co(bdp) and how were they addressed?",
      "answer": "Challenges with breakthrough experiments include Co(bdp)'s significant volume change upon gas adsorption and ensuring accurate gas flow rates. These were addressed by using a column design that allows for material expansion and carefully calibrating flow rates to ensure reliable data.",

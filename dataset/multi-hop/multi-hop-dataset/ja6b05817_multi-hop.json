      "question": "What is the crystalline sponge method and how does it benefit the analysis of ozonides?",
      "answer": "The crystalline sponge method is a technique developed for the micro- to nanogram scale X-ray structure analysis of noncrystalline compounds without crystallization. It benefits the analysis of ozonides by allowing structural analysis to be conducted without product isolation, isomer separation, or crystallization, and most importantly, without any risk of explosion.",

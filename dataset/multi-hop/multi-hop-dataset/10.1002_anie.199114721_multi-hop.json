      "question": "What is the significance of the different coupling constants for 2d and 2e in the structural assignment?",
      "answer": "The different coupling constants for 2d and 2e (J = 4.2 Hz for 2d and J = 8 Hz for 2e) are significant because they are complementary and in the same order of assignment, indicating the larger value for the cis-vicinal coupling constant and the smaller for the corresponding trans. This helps in the structural assignment of the stereoisomers obtained from a stereospecific process starting from trans and cis olefins.",

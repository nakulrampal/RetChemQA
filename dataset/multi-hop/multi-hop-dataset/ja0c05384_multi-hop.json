      "question": "How does the presence of secondary growth on sMOF-NiBr2 indicate about the formation process of surface-bound crystals?",
      "answer": "The formation of secondary growth on sMOF-NiBr2 indicates that the initial surface-bound crystals are formed on reactive, defect areas, and over time, the surface areas of the surface-bound crystals increased and became competitive as templates for crystallization.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"

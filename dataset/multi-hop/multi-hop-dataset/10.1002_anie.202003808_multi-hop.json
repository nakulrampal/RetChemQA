      "question": "Is the presence of lattice water crucial for the thermosalient effect in the triple-helix coordination polymers?",
      "answer": "No, the presence of lattice water is not crucial for the thermosalient effect, as the temperature-dependent structural evolution suggests that lattice water dissociates from the crystal lattice before the onset temperature of crystal jumping for 1 and 2.",

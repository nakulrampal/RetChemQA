    {
      "question": "What is the unique interaction of CPM-107 with CO2?",
      "answer": "CPM-107 abruptly opens and turns into a rigid porous form that is irreversible via desorption when exposed to CO2 at 195 K.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How can the closed phase of CPM-107 be re-locked to its initial state?",
      "answer": "The closed phase of CPM-107 can be re-locked to its initial state via re-solvation and desolvation.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What synthesis conditions led to the formation of CPM-107?",
      "answer": "Reaction of Mg(Ac)2, H2BDC, and acetic acid in DMA and water afforded colorless rod-like crystals denoted as CPM-107as.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the effect of CO2 adsorption at 195 K on CPM-107?",
      "answer": "CO2 adsorption at 195 K leads to a gate-opening effect, transforming CPM-107 from a closed-pore framework to an open-pore framework.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the structural transformations observed in CPM-107?",
      "answer": "Three distinct phases were observed in CPM-107: as-synthesized (CPM-107as), closed (CPM-107cl), and open (CPM-107op).",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of CH2Cl2 in the regeneration of CPM-107cl from CPM-107op?",
      "answer": "Immersing CPM-107op in CH2Cl2 and subsequent desolvation leads to the reverse structural transformation from CPM-107op back to CPM-107cl.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the lock-and-key effect observed in CPM-107?",
      "answer": "The lock-and-key effect signifies that CPM-107 selectively responds to CO2, enabling a guest-selective yet irreversible gate opening.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the shape-memory effect in CPM-107 compare to previously known shape-memory MOFs?",
      "answer": "Unlike previously known shape-memory MOFs, CPM-107's 'memory' phase can be recovered from the open phase by solvent soaking, not just heat or vacuum.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does CPM-107 not revert to its closed phase upon desorption?",
      "answer": "The desorption trace of CPM-107 does not follow the adsorption one, indicating that the open phase (CPM-107op) is stable upon desorption like rigid frameworks.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What factors contribute to the peculiar properties of CPM-107?",
      "answer": "The peculiar properties of CPM-107 are linked to a convergence of factors related to both framework and extra-framework features.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the presence of substituent groups in ligands affect the flexibility of CPM-107?",
      "answer": "The presence of substituent groups in ligands, as seen in CPM-107NH2 and CPM-107OH, restricts hinge motion due to larger steric hindrance and intramolecular H-bonding, leading to rigid MOFs.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of extra-framework cations in CPM-107?",
      "answer": "All framework-guest interactions in CPM-107 are mediated by the cationic [NH2(CH3)2]+, which may contribute to the rigidity of CPM-107op.",

      "type": "reasoning"

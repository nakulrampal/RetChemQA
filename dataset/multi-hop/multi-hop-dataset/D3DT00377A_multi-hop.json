      "question": "What are the key properties of lanthanide isostructural complexes derived from aspartic acid that make them suitable for fluorescence sensing?",
      "answer": "Lanthanide isostructural complexes derived from aspartic acid exhibit high stability, adjustable peak emission optical properties, and lifetime. They can display different emission wavelengths from UV-visible light to infrared light under different excitation wavelengths by selecting appropriate lanthanide ions, making them suitable for fluorescence sensing.",

      "question": "How does complex 6 specifically recognize Cr(VI) ions in an aqueous suspension?",
      "answer": "Complex 6 specifically recognizes Cr(VI) ions in an aqueous suspension through fluorescence quenching, which is more pronounced for Cr(VI) ions compared to other ions. This indicates that complex 6 might have selectivity in the luminescence response to Cr(VI).",

      "question": "What is the limit of detection (LOD) for Cr2O7 2- and CrO4 2- ions using complex 6, and how does it compare to the requirements of the American Health Institute?",
      "answer": "The limit of detection (LOD) for Cr2O7 2- ions using complex 6 is 3.66 nM, and for CrO4 2- ions, it is 5.35 nM. The detection limit for Cr(VI) using complex 6 is far lower than the other Tb-complex of fluorescence sensing reported and far lower than the requirements of the American Health Institute.",

    {
      "question": "What mechanisms contribute to the fluorescence quenching of complex 6 for Cr(VI) and TCs?",
      "answer": "The fluorescence quenching of complex 6 for Cr(VI) and TCs is due to competitive absorption mechanism, resonance energy transfer energy transfer mechanism of the excited-state interaction between complex 6 and Cr(VI) or TCs, and electrostatic interaction between Tb(III) of complex 6 and Cr(VI).",

      "question": "What are the limits of detection (LOD) for chlortetracycline (CTC) and tetracycline (TC) using complex 6, and how do they compare to other complexes?",
      "answer": "The limits of detection (LOD) for chlortetracycline (CTC) using complex 6 are 0.25 μM, and for tetracycline (TC), it is 0.24 μM. The ability of complex 6 for recognizing TCs is lower than many other complexes, indicating its high sensitivity.",

    {
      "question": "How does the fluorescence intensity of complex 6 change with the addition of different ions and biomolecules?",
      "answer": "The fluorescence intensity of complex 6 decreases significantly with the addition of Cr(VI) ions and tetracycline antibiotics (TCs) compared to other ions and biomolecules, indicating its selectivity towards Cr(VI) and TCs.",

      "question": "What role do amino acid derivatives play in the synthesis and properties of lanthanide isostructural complexes?",
      "answer": "Amino acid derivatives, such as aspartic acid derivative used in this study, serve as excellent ligands for designing and synthesizing metal complexes with various structures. They contain rich hydrogen bonds, which can improve the molecular recognition rate and reduce the detection limit, making them good candidates for the synthesis of fluorescence sensing materials.",

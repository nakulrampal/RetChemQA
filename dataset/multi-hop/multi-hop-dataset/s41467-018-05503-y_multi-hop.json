      "question": "What are the six distinct phases observed in the study of X-pcu-1-Zn's response to various stimuli?",
      "answer": "X-pcu-1-Zn-3i-α, X-pcu-1-Zn-3i-β, X-pcu-1-Zn-3i-γ, X-pcu-1-Zn-3i-δ, X-pcu-2-Zn-3i, and X-pcu-1-Zn-4i.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What triggers the breathing phenomenon in X-pcu-1-Zn?",
      "answer": "The breathing phenomenon in X-pcu-1-Zn is triggered by heat or vacuum.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the structural isomerism in X-pcu-1-Zn occur?",
      "answer": "Structural isomerism in X-pcu-1-Zn occurs through solvent exchange with acetonitrile followed by heating, which transforms Zn2(carboxylate)4 square paddlewheel nodes to Zn2(carboxylate)4 nodes with tetrahedral Zn atoms.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the shape memory effect observed in X-pcu-1-Zn?",
      "answer": "The shape memory effect observed in X-pcu-1-Zn is significant because it demonstrates the material's ability to undergo a structural transformation and revert back to its original form, which is a rare and poorly understood phenomenon in crystalline porous materials.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What leads to the change in the level of interpenetration in X-pcu-1-Zn?",
      "answer": "The change in the level of interpenetration in X-pcu-1-Zn is induced by heat and/or vacuum, which facilitates an increase in the degree of interpenetration from threefold to fourfold through breakage/regeneration of coordination bonds.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The transformations observed in X-pcu-1-Zn are reversible.",
      "answer": "True, except for the transformation to X-pcu-1-Zn-4i, which appears to be irreversible.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role do weak interactions play in the shape memory effect of X-pcu-1-Zn?",
      "answer": "Weak interactions, such as short C–H···O contacts between interpenetrated networks, play a role in enabling the kinetically stable shape memory effect by reducing strain in the nodes and linkers.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The breathing phenomenon in X-pcu-1-Zn results in a change in network connectivity.",
      "answer": "False, the breathing phenomenon typically involves structural distortions enabled by changes in bond angles and bond lengths without a change in network connectivity.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What experimental techniques were used to characterize the structural transformations in X-pcu-1-Zn?",
      "answer": "The structural transformations in X-pcu-1-Zn were characterized using in-situ variable temperature PXRD, SCXRD, thermal microscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The study of X-pcu-1-Zn's response to various stimuli revealed the material's potential for applications in gas storage and separation.",
      "answer": "True, the study highlighted the material's structural flexibility and transformations, which are relevant to potential applications in gas storage and separation.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"

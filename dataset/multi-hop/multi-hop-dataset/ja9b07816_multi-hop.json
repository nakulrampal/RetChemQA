    {
      "question": "What is the reason given for the high Rint value in the CIF report?",
      "answer": "The high Rint value is attributed to the crystal being very small and weakly diffracting, leading to the use of essentially 'unobserved' reflections in the refinement.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the chemical formula of the structure analyzed, as per the CIF report?",

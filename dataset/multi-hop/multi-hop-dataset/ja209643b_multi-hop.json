      "question": "What is the purpose of using meso-tetra(N-methyl-4-pyridyl)porphine tetratosylate (TMPyP) in the synthesis of porph@MOM-10?",
      "answer": "TMPyP is used as a structure-directing agent (SDA) to template the formation of porph@MOM-10, where it facilitates the self-assembly of the framework around porphyrin molecules, trapping them in a 'ship-in-a-bottle' fashion.",

    {
      "question": "How does the synthesis condition differ when producing Mnporph@MOM-10-Mn compared to Cuporph@MOM-10-CdCu?",
      "answer": "For Mnporph@MOM-10-Mn, crystals of porph@MOM-10 are placed in a methanol solution of MnCl2·4H2O, while for Cuporph@MOM-10-CdCu, a similar procedure is followed but using CuCl2·2H2O instead of MnCl2·4H2O.",

    {
      "question": "What is the role of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in the study of porph@MOMs?",
      "answer": "TGA is used to evaluate the thermal stability of porph@MOMs, providing information on weight loss at different temperatures which indicates the decomposition or stability of the materials.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is the postsynthetic metal exchange (PSM) process significant in the context of porph@MOM-10?",
      "answer": "The PSM process allows for the exchange of metal ions within the porph@MOM-10 framework, enabling the study of different metalloporphyrins' impact on properties such as catalysis, gas sorption, and luminescence without altering the overall structure.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"

    {
      "question": "Is the synthesis of porph@MOM-10 dependent on the presence of TMPyP?",
      "answer": "True. The synthesis of porph@MOM-10 requires TMPyP as a structure-directing agent to template the formation of the framework around porphyrin molecules.",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can porph@MOM-10 undergo postsynthetic metal exchange to produce variants like Mnporph@MOM-10-Mn and Cuporph@MOM-10-CdCu without losing its crystallinity?",
      "answer": "True. Porph@MOM-10 can undergo postsynthetic metal exchange to produce variants such as Mnporph@MOM-10-Mn and Cuporph@MOM-10-CdCu while retaining its crystallinity.",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"

    {
      "question": "Does the catalytic activity of porph@MOM-10 and its variants for the epoxidation of trans-stilbene depend on the metal ion present in the metalloporphyrin?",
      "answer": "True. The catalytic activity of porph@MOM-10 and its variants for the epoxidation of trans-stilbene is influenced by the type of metal ion present in the metalloporphyrin, as demonstrated by the different conversion rates and product selectivities.",
      "difficulty": "easy",

    },
    {
      "question": "What method is used to confirm the structural integrity of porph@MOM-10 after postsynthetic metal exchange?",
      "answer": "Single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) is used to confirm the structural integrity of porph@MOM-10 after postsynthetic metal exchange, ensuring that the parent framework is retained.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the gas adsorption capability of porph@MOM-10 compare to its metal-exchanged variants?",
      "answer": "The gas adsorption capability of porph@MOM-10 and its metal-exchanged variants differ, as indicated by the N2 and H2 adsorption studies, which show variations in adsorption capacities and isosteric heats of adsorption.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the synthesis of porph@MOM-10 without TMPyP possible, resulting in the same product?",
      "answer": "False. The synthesis of porph@MOM-10 requires TMPyP as a structure-directing agent. Conducting the synthesis without TMPyP results in a different product, as demonstrated by the comparison of experimental and calculated powder X-ray diffraction patterns.",
      "difficulty": "easy",

    {
      "question": "How does the synthesis condition of [PbI2(4F-spy)2], 1, influence its thermosalience effect?",
      "answer": "The synthesis by evaporating a DMF solution containing PbI2 and 4F-spy ligand at a 1:2 ratio leads to the formation of crystals that exhibit reversible thermosalience due to martensitic phase transition",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the thermosalience effect in CPs commonly reversible?",
      "answer": "False, the reversibility of thermosalience in CPs is rare",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "Does the thermosalience effect in [PbI2(4F-spy)2] occur due to nonmolecular crystal movements?",
      "answer": "True, the thermosalience effect is due to the martensitic phase transition causing nonmolecular crystal movements",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can the thermosalience effect in [PbI2(4F-spy)2] be repeated for multiple heating-cooling cycles without loss of functionality?",
      "answer": "True, the reversible actuation of the CP could be repeated for 20 heating-cooling cycles, suggesting its potential as a multicyclic actuator",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What experimental technique was used to directly visualize the thermal responsiveness and confirmation of the TS effect?",
      "answer": "Hot stage microscopy",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the crystal structure transformation from phase I to phase II at 408 K affect the thermosalience effect?",
      "answer": "The transformation from triclinic space group P1Ì… in phase I to monoclinic space group C2/m in phase II is unusual and contributes to the thermosalience effect by redefining crystallographic axes and causing contraction and expansion along the longest crystal dimension",
      "difficulty": "hard",

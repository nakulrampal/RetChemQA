      "question": "What is the main focus of the study conducted on ZnPC-2 and its iso-reticular structures?",
      "answer": "The main focus of the study is to explore the catalytic CO2 cycloaddition reaction over Tetrahedral Coordination Lewis Acidic Sites in a Rutile-type Zinc-phosphonocarboxylate Framework and to investigate the structure-property relationship (SPR) by designing iso-reticular structures such as Hpyr@ZnPC-2, MZnPC-2, and ZnPC-2-im.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does the presence of TBAB affect the yield of cyclic carbonates in the CO2 cycloaddition reaction over ZnPC-2?",
      "answer": "The presence of TBAB as a co-catalyst significantly increases the yield of cyclic carbonates in the CO2 cycloaddition reaction over ZnPC-2, indicating the importance of co-catalyst for the nucleophilic attacking.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does the apical Zn(II) in Zn3-SBU play in the catalytic process according to the study?",
      "answer": "The apical Zn(II) in Zn3-SBU plays the dominant catalytic role as a Lewis acidic site in the CO2 cycloaddition reaction, and its ability to dynamically transform from tetrahedron to high coordination geometry is crucial for the catalysis process.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What experimental and computational methods were used to investigate the catalytic CO2 cycloaddition reaction over ZnPC-2?",
      "answer": "The study used Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Scanning electron microscope mapping (SEM-mapping), Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES), Single crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD), and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the catalytic CO2 cycloaddition reaction over ZnPC-2.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the dynamical and reversible transformation of the apical Zn(II) in Zn3-SBU during the catalytic process?",
      "answer": "The dynamical and reversible transformation of the apical Zn(II) from four-coordinated tetrahedral geometry to five-coordinated square-pyramidal geometry is significant because it enables the activation of the C-O bond from epoxides and facilitates the insertion of CO2 into the activated epoxide, leading to the formation of cyclic carbonates.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },

    {
      "question": "What challenges does the study address in the context of metalâ€“organic frameworks (MOFs) as CO2-epoxide cycloaddition catalysts?",
      "answer": "The study addresses the challenge of ambiguous catalytic sites in MOFs as CO2-epoxide cycloaddition catalysts and the difficulty in precisely modifying the structures to optimize catalytic performance.",

    {
      "question": "How does the study contribute to the field of reticular chemistry and MOF-based catalysis?",
      "answer": "The study contributes by employing reticular chemistry to design iso-reticular Zn-phosphonocarboxylate frameworks, providing insights into the structure-property relationship and identifying the apical Zn(II) in Zn3-SBU as the active catalytic site, thus advancing the understanding and application of MOF-based catalysis in CO2 conversion.",

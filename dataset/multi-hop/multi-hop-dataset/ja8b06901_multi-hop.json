    {
      "question": "How does the derivative DPd exhibit thermochromic luminescence?",
      "answer": "Derivative DPd exhibits thermochromic luminescence by showing a gradual red-shift in its emission spectrum upon cooling, associated with intense solid-state green luminescence at low temperature, indicative of a TADF mechanism.",

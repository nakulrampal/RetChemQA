      "question": "What is the process used to synthesize the doubly linked corrole dimer 1?",
      "answer": "The synthesis of doubly linked corrole dimer 1 began with 2-borylcorrole 2. Palladium-catalyzed oxidative coupling of 2 using chloroacetone as an oxidant afforded the 2,2‘-linked corrole dimer 3 in excellent yield. Further oxidation of 3 with DDQ in toluene provided one product, 4, as an air- and moisture-stable solid in moderate yield. Reduction of 4 with NaBH4 resulted in a solution color change from brown to green and gave 1 quantitatively.",

      "question": "What are the key spectral characteristics of the doubly linked corrole dimer 1?",
      "answer": "The 1H NMR spectrum of 1 elucidated its symmetrical structure, exhibiting one singlet peak (8.91 ppm) and two doublet peaks (8.66 and 8.48 ppm) in the deshielded region. The electronic absorption spectrum of 1 exhibits three main bands at 396, 472, and 721 nm, which are characteristic of corroles but slightly red-shifted compared to those of monomers.",

      "question": "How does the biradical character of compound 6 manifest in its physical properties?",
      "answer": "Compound 6 exhibits biradical character as indicated by its ESR spectrum showing a single peak at g = 2.0053, and temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility measurements revealing a χpT value that is temperature independent, ∼0.0 emu K mol-1, below 150 K and gradually increases above 150 K. These results indicate that 6 has a biradical character, with the singlet ground state.",

      "question": "What is the significance of the planar structures of complexes 5 and 6 as revealed by X-ray crystal analysis?",
      "answer": "The planar structures of complexes 5 and 6, including the COT cores, suggest that the ligand of 6, free base 4, has two NH protons in each of the corrole cores. This structural feature is significant as it supports the biradicaloid character of these complexes and is consistent with their unusual electronic and magnetic properties.",

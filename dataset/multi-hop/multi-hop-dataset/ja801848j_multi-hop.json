      "question": "How does the BET surface area of modified IRMOF-3 samples change with increasing alkyl chain length?",
      "answer": "The BET surface area of modified IRMOF-3 samples first decreases from IRMOF-3-AM2 to IRMOF-3-AM6, then increases from IRMOF-3-AM7 to IRMOF-3-AM19.",

      "question": "What is the relationship between the degree of modification and the porosity of modified IRMOF-3 samples?",
      "answer": "The degree of modification and the porosity of modified IRMOF-3 samples are mutually related, with a correlation between alkyl chain length and percent conversion affecting the overall porosity.",

      "question": "Is the postsynthetic modification approach limited to IRMOF-3 or is it applicable to a wider range of MOFs?",
      "answer": "The postsynthetic modification approach is not limited to IRMOF-3; it is a versatile and general method applicable to a wider range of MOFs.",
      "difficulty": "medium",

    },
    {
      "question": "What factors influence the kinetics of postsynthetic modification reactions in MOFs?",
      "answer": "The kinetics of postsynthetic modification reactions in MOFs are influenced by steric effects, diffusion of reagents, and the reactivity of the reagents.",

    {
      "question": "Does the modification of IRMOF-3 with alkyl anhydrides preserve its crystallinity and thermal stability?",
      "answer": "Yes, the modification of IRMOF-3 with alkyl anhydrides preserves its crystallinity and thermal stability.",

    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the 'well-shaped' curve observed in the plot of BET surface area versus alkyl chain length for modified IRMOF-3 samples?",
      "answer": "The 'well-shaped' curve signifies that the porosity of modified IRMOF-3 samples decreases and then increases with alkyl chain length, indicating changes in the pore structure due to the presence of acyl substituents.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "Are the observed acid peaks in the 1H NMR spectra of digested modified samples due to hydrolysis of the modified ligand?",
      "answer": "No, the observed acid peaks in the 1H NMR spectra of digested modified samples are due to trapping of byproducts during modification within the MOF lattice, not hydrolysis of the modified ligand.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the postsynthetic modification approach compare to traditional MOF synthesis methods in terms of atom economy?",
      "answer": "The postsynthetic modification approach may offer superior atom economy compared to traditional MOF synthesis methods, especially for systematically generating a series of MOFs.",

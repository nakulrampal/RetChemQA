      "question": "What are the synthesis conditions for 4,4’-bis(1H-pyrazol-4-yl)biphenyl (1, H2pbp)?",
      "answer": "The synthesis conditions for 4,4’-bis(1H-pyrazol-4-yl)biphenyl (1, H2pbp) involve starting from 4,4'-Bis(chloromethyl)-1,1'-biphenyl, undergoing a series of reactions including treatment with NaCN in DMSO, KOH/H2O/EtOH, POCl3/DMF, and finally reacting with hydrazine in 2-methoxyethanol.",

    {
      "question": "How does the color of species 4 change upon activation and what does it indicate?",
      "answer": "The color of species 4 does not change substantially upon activation in vacuo at 453 K, indicating that the local structure around the Ni(II) sites is significantly distorted upon outgassing, but the overall color appearance remains similar.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What spectroscopic technique was used to confirm the presence of Ni(II) in species 4 and what was the result?",
      "answer": "X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XANES) at the Ni K-edge was used to confirm the presence of Ni(II) in species 4. The spectrum showed features similar to the Ni-CPO-27 MOF, indicating Ni(II) species in octahedral-like local symmetry.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The EXAFS data analysis for species 4 suggested a lattice contraction of 3%.",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What was observed during the thermodiffractometric measurements of species 4 when heated in air up to 410 °C?",
      "answer": "During the thermodiffractometric measurements of species 4, the XRPD pattern remained substantially constant when heated in air up to 410 °C, indicating the structural stability of the material in this temperature range.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What does the formation of OH···CO adducts in species 4 indicate about its structure?",
      "answer": "The formation of OH···CO adducts in species 4 upon exposure to CO at low temperature indicates the presence of Brønsted and Lewis sites, suggesting that the structure has active sites capable of interacting with CO molecules.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The reaction of H2tet with NiCl2·6H2O affords a different product than when reacted with Ni(OAc)2·4H2O.",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What was the purpose of performing D2O exchange experiments on species 4, and what was the outcome?",
      "answer": "The purpose of performing D2O exchange experiments on species 4 was to test the availability of hydroxyl groups and structural water molecules. The outcome showed the appearance of strong bands around 2500 cm-1 due to adsorbed species, indicating the presence of structural D2O.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the presence of extraframework cations in species 4 affect its interaction with CO?",
      "answer": "The absence of any components at higher frequencies during the interaction of species 4 with CO suggests that there are no extraframework cations (e.g., Ni(II) species acting as counterions) forming strong Ni(II)···CO species, indicating a specific interaction behavior of the framework with CO.",
      "difficulty": "medium",

    {
      "question": "True or False: The synthesis of 2,6-bis(1H-pyrazol-4-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-f]isoindole-1,3,5,7(2H,6H)-tetrone (2, H2tet) involves a one-pot reaction with pyromellitic dianhydride and 4-aminopyrazole.",

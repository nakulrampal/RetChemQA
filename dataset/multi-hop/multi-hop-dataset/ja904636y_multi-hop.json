    {
      "question": "What happens to the NaLa(H4L) framework upon dehydration according to the study?",
      "answer": "Upon dehydration, the NaLa(H4L) framework contracts, leading to a decrease in the cell volume by 15%.",

      "question": "Which ions were successfully exchanged with Na+ ions in NaLa(H4L) according to the ion-exchange experiments?",
      "answer": "Monovalent ions (Li+, K+, Rb+, and Cs+) were successfully exchanged with Na+ ions in NaLa(H4L).",

    {
      "question": "What role do the guest cations play in the structure of NaLa(H4L) according to the study?",
      "answer": "The guest cations play a crucial role in the chain-forming mechanism and the adaptation of the framework to the size of the cation, contributing significantly to its stabilization and charge balance.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the framework of NaLa(H4L) adapt to different monovalent ions according to the study?",
      "answer": "The framework of NaLa(H4L) adapts to different monovalent ions by changing its structure to accommodate the size of the incorporated ion, leading to a volume change of up to 22%.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the effect of the ionic radius and enthalpy of hydration of the guest cation on NaLa(H4L)?",

    {
      "question": "Why does NaLa(H4L) show selectivity towards monovalent ions over divalent ions?",
      "answer": "NaLa(H4L) shows selectivity towards monovalent ions over divalent ions because divalent cations could only occupy every second guest site, which might reduce the stability of the framework and make the incorporation of divalent cations difficult.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the dehydration process of NaLa(H4L) reversible, and what does it indicate about the framework's flexibility?",
      "answer": "Yes, the dehydration process of NaLa(H4L) is fully reversible, indicating significant flexibility in the framework that allows it to adapt to the presence or absence of water molecules.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the presence of water molecules affect the structure of NaLa(H4L)?",
      "answer": "The presence of water molecules in NaLa(H4L) leads to an expanded form of the framework, and their removal through dehydration causes the framework to contract.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can Rb+ ions be exchanged for Na+ ions in NaLa(H4L) according to the study?",
      "answer": "Yes, Rb+ ions can be exchanged for Na+ ions in NaLa(H4L), but the framework remains in a contracted form.",

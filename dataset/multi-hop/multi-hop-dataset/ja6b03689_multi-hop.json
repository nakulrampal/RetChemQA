      "question": "What is the primary purpose of metalation of Zr3(μ3-OH) sites in SBUs of TPHN-MOF with Me2Mg?",
      "answer": "The primary purpose is to afford Mg-functionalized MOF material (TPHN-MOF-MgMe) as a highly active and reusable solid catalyst for hydroboration of carbonyls and imines and for hydroamination of aminopentenes.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does the presence of Mg in TPHN-MOF influence its catalytic activity for organic transformations?",
      "answer": "The presence of Mg in TPHN-MOF stabilizes catalytically active heteroleptic Mg-alkyl species by shutting down Schlenk-type intermolecular ligand redistribution reactions, thus enhancing its catalytic activity for organic transformations.",

    {
      "question": "What role does the site isolation within MOFs play in the stabilization of heteroleptic alkaline earth metal species?",
      "answer": "Site isolation within MOFs stabilizes heteroleptic alkaline earth metal species by providing site isolation without relying on bulky ligands, thus offering an alternative route for obtaining active catalysts.",

    {
      "question": "How does the synthesis condition of TPHN-MOF affect its application in catalysis?",
      "answer": "The synthesis condition of TPHN-MOF, specifically the metalation with Me2Mg, affects its application in catalysis by creating Mg-functionalized MOF material (TPHN-MOF-MgMe) that exhibits high catalytic activity and reusability for hydroboration and hydroamination reactions.",

    {
      "question": "Can TPHN-MOF-Mg be reused without loss of MOF crystallinity and catalytic activity?",
      "answer": "Yes, TPHN-MOF-Mg can be recovered and reused for hydroboration of acetophenone at least 10 times without loss of MOF crystallinity and with consistent excellent yields of borate ester, indicating its stability and reusability.",

    {
      "question": "Does the heterogeneity of MOF-Mg catalysis in hydroboration reactions depend on the presence of the solid catalyst?",
      "answer": "Yes, the heterogeneity of MOF-Mg catalysis in hydroboration reactions depends on the presence of the solid catalyst, as evidenced by the stoppage of hydroboration of 4-methoxyacetophenone after removing TPHN-MOF-Mg from the reaction mixture.",
      "difficulty": "medium",

    },
    {
      "question": "Is the formation of H2 during the catalytic hydroboration reaction with TPHN-MOF-MgMe indicative of the decomposition of HBpin?",
      "answer": "No, the formation of H2 during the catalytic hydroboration reaction with TPHN-MOF-MgMe is not indicative of the decomposition of HBpin but is due to the formation of µ4-O-Mg(Bpin) species via reaction of µ4-O-Mg-H with excess HBpin.",

      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What experimental evidence supports the heterogeneous nature of MOF catalysis in hydroboration reactions?",
      "answer": "The experimental evidence supporting the heterogeneous nature of MOF catalysis in hydroboration reactions is the observation that hydroboration of 4-methoxyacetophenone stopped after removing TPHN-MOF-Mg from the reaction mixture.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the empirical rate law for hydroboration of acetophenone catalyzed by MOF-Mg relate to the concentrations of Mg and acetophenone?",
      "answer": "The empirical rate law for hydroboration of acetophenone catalyzed by MOF-Mg shows a first-order dependence on both the Mg and acetophenone concentrations, indicating that the reaction rate is directly proportional to the concentrations of these components.",

    },
    {
      "question": "Does the use of unmetalated TPHN-MOF in hydroamination of aminopentene result in the formation of the desired product?",
      "answer": "No, the use of unmetalated TPHN-MOF in hydroamination of aminopentene does not result in the formation of the desired product, suggesting that the catalysis occurs at the supported Mg centers at the SBUs.",

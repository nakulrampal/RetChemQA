      "question": "What is the significance of the unh topology observed in the synthesized MOFs?",
      "answer": "The unh topology observed in the synthesized MOFs is significant because it belongs to an extremely rare class of topology, whose existence has been predicted but only rarely perceived in the literature on organic–inorganic hybrid materials or zeolites.",

    {
      "question": "How does the water sorption capability of the MOFs vary with their framework constituents?",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does the temperature affect the hydrolytic stability of the homochiral MOFs?",
      "answer": "At elevated temperatures (50–120°C), the homochiral MOFs get deconstructed in water to form a turbid solution, which upon further heating and evaporation of water, leads to the regeneration of the MOFs.",

      "question": "Can the MOFs' water sorption capacity be directly linked to the presence of lattice water molecules?",
      "answer": "True, the MOFs' water sorption capacity can be linked to the presence of lattice water molecules, which are weakly hydrogen bonded to the coordinated anions forming a helical water arrangement inside the framework.",

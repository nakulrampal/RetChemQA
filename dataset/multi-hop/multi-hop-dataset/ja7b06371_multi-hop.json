    {
      "question": "How were the fluorescence measurements for the sensors conducted?",
      "answer": "Fluorescence measurements were performed using a single photon counting spectrofluorimeter from Edinburgh Analytical Instruments (FL/FS 920), with solutions prepared in square quartz cuvettes and excited at specific wavelengths for each sensor (301 nm or 320 nm for S1, 310 nm for S2, and 300 nm for S3).",

    {
      "question": "How does the structure of the aCBs influence their ability to detect opiates and their metabolites?",
      "answer": "The structure and steric demand of the terminal walls of the aCBs partly define the diameter of the binding pocket, influencing the preference for the size of the guests. This structural adaptability allows the aCBs to accommodate drugs of varying sizes, affecting their sensitivity and specificity towards opiates and their metabolites.",

    {
      "question": "What role does the pH of the solution play in the fluorescence measurements of the sensors?",
      "answer": "The pH of the solution is crucial for the fluorescence measurements of the sensors, as it can influence the binding interactions between the sensors and the analytes. The experiments were conducted at different pH levels (pH 3, pH 5, and pH 7) to optimize the conditions for maximum fluorescence response.",

      "question": "How does the binding affinity of sensor S2 compare for morphine, heroin, and oxycodone according to both experimental and computational data?",
      "answer": "According to both experimental and computational data, sensor S2 shows varying binding affinities for morphine, heroin, and oxycodone, with specific binding constants and complexation energies indicating a preference for certain opiates over others.",

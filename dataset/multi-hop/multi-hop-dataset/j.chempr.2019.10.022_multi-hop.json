      "question": "What is the purpose of using IPrAu(III)Cl-MOF in the synthesis process described?",
      "answer": "The purpose of using IPrAu(III)Cl-MOF in the synthesis process is to incorporate a gold(III) precatalyst into metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) for architectural stabilization, which aims to prevent a unimolecular decomposition pathway of the gold(III) catalyst.",

      "question": "How does the presence of 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene (TMB) affect the decomposition of homogeneous gold(III) complexes?",
      "answer": "The presence of 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene (TMB) exacerbates the decomposition of homogeneous gold(III) complexes by acting as a trap for cationic gold(I) species, leading to the formation of Au(I)-TMB adduct and promoting reductive elimination.",

      "question": "What role does TBAF play in the synthesis of diol IPrAu(III)(biphenyl)Cl complex (SI 6)?",
      "answer": "TBAF is used to remove the TBS protecting groups from the TBS-protected IPrAu(III)(biphenyl)Cl complex (SI 5), resulting in the formation of the diol IPrAu(III)(biphenyl)Cl complex (SI 6) with free hydroxyl groups.",

      "question": "What is the significance of the solvent screening experiments with IPrAu(III)PF6-bio-MOF-100-catalyzed alkynyl cycloheptatriene cycloisomerization reaction?",
      "answer": "The solvent screening experiments with IPrAu(III)PF6-bio-MOF-100-catalyzed alkynyl cycloheptatriene cycloisomerization reaction are significant because they help identify the optimal solvent that maximizes the reaction's efficiency, conversion rate, and product selectivity, thereby improving the overall catalytic performance.",

      "question": "True or False: The digestion 1H NMR analysis of IPrAu(III)Cl-MOFs after catalysis detected the presence of biphenylene or Au(I) species.",
      "answer": "False. The digestion 1H NMR analysis of IPrAu(III)Cl-MOFs after catalysis did not detect the presence of biphenylene or Au(I) species, indicating that the MOF successfully prevented the unimolecular decomposition of the gold(III) catalyst.",

    {
      "question": "How does the architectural stabilization strategy benefit the preservation of ligand geometry in transition-metal catalysis?",
      "answer": "The architectural stabilization strategy benefits the preservation of ligand geometry in transition-metal catalysis by constraining the geometry of the catalyst within a rigid metal-organic framework. This prevents undesired bending effects and unimolecular decomposition pathways, such as reductive elimination, thereby enhancing the catalyst's stability and performance.",

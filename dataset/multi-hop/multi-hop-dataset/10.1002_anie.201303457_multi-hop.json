      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why was the synthesis of nucleophilic boron compounds historically challenging?",
      "answer": "The synthesis was challenging due to the electron deficiency of trivalent boron compounds, making them usually electrophilic and thus difficult to synthesize as nucleophilic derivatives.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does the potassium cation play in the structure of the monomeric boryl anion 4?",

    {
      "question": "Can the boryl anion A be prepared by deprotonation?",

    {
      "question": "What was the significance of the zwitterionic gold complex synthesized in the study?",
      "answer": "The zwitterionic gold complex synthesized in the study was significant because it demonstrated the utility of the carbanionic phosphines to stabilize zwitterionic complexes with a cationic gold center, which were found to be active catalysts for the hydroamination of phenylacetylene without requiring an additional activation step.",

      "question": "How does the presence of a carbanionic electron-donating substituent affect the properties of phosphines?",
      "answer": "The presence of a carbanionic electron-donating substituent significantly increases the donor strength and basicity of phosphines, making them highly electron-rich donors with exclusive phosphorus-centered reactivity.",

      "question": "True or False: The PH ylides formed in the study are unstable in solution and rapidly convert to their phosphine forms.",

      "question": "What was the observed effect of solvent on the equilibrium between the PH ylide and phosphine forms of the synthesized compounds?",
      "answer": "The observed effect of solvent on the equilibrium between the PH ylide and phosphine forms was that the ylidic form tends to be preferred in polar solvents, with minor solvent dependency that does not perfectly correlate with the polarity of the solvents.",

    {
      "question": "True or False: The study demonstrated that the carbanionic phosphines could not be directly synthesized from their precursors.",

      "question": "What was the role of bis(sulfonyl)methanides in the synthesis of the phosphines?",
      "answer": "Bis(sulfonyl)methanides played a crucial role in the synthesis of the phosphines by serving as precursors that, upon reaction with respective chlorophosphines or through direct synthesis routes, led to the formation of the desired phosphines.",

      "question": "What is the significance of the elongation of the C-F bond in diborylcarbenoid 2F upon deprotonation?",
      "answer": "The elongation of the C-F bond in diborylcarbenoid 2F upon deprotonation suggests that the C-F bond was activated by forming carbenoid.",

      "question": "Why does the CB2N2 5-membered ring in singlet DBC 1 have a distorted geometry?",
      "answer": "The CB2N2 5-membered ring in singlet DBC 1 has a distorted geometry due to the maximization of π-conjugation of CB2N2 ring and aromatic substituents on the boron and nitrogen atom.",

      "question": "What does the HOMO of singlet DBC 1' indicate about its Lewis acidic nature?",
      "answer": "The HOMO of singlet DBC 1' indicates that DBC itself should exhibit Lewis acidic nature due to the naked vacant orbital on the carbene carbon.",

      "question": "How does the stability of triplet state compare to singlet state for both DBC 1 and DBC 1'?",
      "answer": "For both DBC 1 and DBC 1', the triplet state was more stable than the singlet state at any level of theory discussed.",

      "question": "What is the role of the aromatic substituents on the boron and nitrogen atoms in the structure of DBC 1?",
      "answer": "The aromatic substituents on the boron and nitrogen atoms in DBC 1 play a role in the structural distortion of the CB2N2 5-membered ring by maximizing π-conjugation.",

      "question": "Why is the nucleophilic attack toward the carbenoid carbon atom in 2Cl less probable?",
      "answer": "The nucleophilic attack toward the carbenoid carbon atom in 2Cl is less probable due to the nucleophilicity of the carbenoid carbon, steric protection by bulky mesityl group, and the low capacity of the carbenoid carbon to accept nucleophiles.",

      "question": "What does the significant elongation of the Ccarbene-F distance in 1-FAl suggest?",
      "answer": "The significant elongation of the Ccarbene-F distance in 1-FAl suggests that the interaction with the aluminum atom weakens the C-F bond, indicating activation towards forming DBC.",

      "question": "How does the planarity of the CB2N2 5-membered ring in the triplet state of DBC 1 compare to its singlet state?",
      "answer": "In the triplet state of DBC 1, the CB2N2 5-membered ring maintains planarity, in contrast to its singlet state where the ring has a distorted geometry.",

    {
      "question": "What conclusion can be drawn from the calculation results regarding the nucleophilicity of the carbenoid carbon in 2Cl?",
      "answer": "The calculation results suggest that the carbenoid carbon in 2Cl exhibits nucleophilicity, which, along with steric protection and low capacity to accept nucleophiles, makes nucleophilic attack less probable.",

      "question": "Is the S–T gap of DBC 1 significantly dependent on the functional and basis set employed?",
      "answer": "Yes, the S–T gap of DBC 1 is significantly dependent on the functional and basis set employed, while the simplified structure DBC 1' showed almost no dependency.",

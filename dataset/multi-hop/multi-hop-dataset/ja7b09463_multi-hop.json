      "question": "What are the synthesis conditions for PTC-101?",
      "answer": "Ti(OiPr)4 (160 μL, 0.5 mmol), H4L (155 mg, 0.4 mmol), and 2 drops of ethylenediamine (en) were added to 6 mL of n-propanol/DMF (3:1 v/v) and mixed at room temperature. The resultant solution was heated at 100 °C for 3 days. After cooling to room temperature, red crystals of PTC-101 were obtained.",

      "answer": "The organometallic building block [CuI2(m2-BQ)(m2-OAc)2] is key to the formation of supramolecular isomers because it has two types of supramolecular synthons on coordination, which allows for the infinite assembly of the building block and the formation of a variety of supramolecular isomers due to competition between two different intermolecular interactions.",

    {
      "question": "How does the reaction temperature influence the formation of different supramolecular isomers?",
      "answer": "The reaction temperature influences the formation of different supramolecular isomers by controlling the crystallization process. High-temperature reaction conditions and low concentration of the molecular building block favor the thermodynamically controlled crystallization of the g phase, while lower temperatures and higher concentrations favor the kinetically controlled crystallization of the a phase.",

      "answer": "The reaction concentration, along with temperature, affects the isolation of pure a, b, and g phases by influencing the crystallization process. Higher concentrations favor the kinetically controlled crystallization of the a phase, while lower concentrations and higher temperatures favor the thermodynamically controlled crystallization of the g phase.",

    {
      "question": "How does the Cu–Cu distance compare among the a, b, and g phases?",
      "answer": "The Cu–Cu distance of the g phase is longer than those of the a and b phases, indicating a distortion from the ideal C2v symmetrical structure in the crystals of the g phase.",

      "answer": "According to the Ostwald step rule, the nucleation speed is determined by the activation energy of nucleation, which decreases as the interfacial tension decreases. Since solubility is inversely proportional to the interfacial tension, the precipitation of the more soluble, or metastable, phase is kinetically promoted under low temperature conditions.",

    {
      "question": "What is the empirical rule known as the Ostwald step rule, and how does it apply to the system described in the paper?",
      "answer": "The Ostwald step rule is an empirical rule stating that the metastable phase with the higher solubility tends to be kinetically favored due to lower activation energy of nucleation at a given supersaturation ratio. In the system described, this rule explains the preference for the formation of different supramolecular isomers under varying temperature and concentration conditions, based on the difference in interaction energy between two supramolecular synthons.",

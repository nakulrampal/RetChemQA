      "question": "How does the photocatalytic activity of PCN-808-BDBR compare to that of free [Ru(bpy)3]2+ cations in the aza-Henry reaction?",
      "answer": "The photocatalytic activity of PCN-808-BDBR is similar to that of the free [Ru(bpy)3]2+ cations, indicating that the Ru-immobilized mesoporous MOF is a highly effective photocatalyst.",

      "question": "What is the significance of the mesoporous nature of PCN-808-BDBR in photocatalytic reactions involving large substituents?",
      "answer": "The mesoporous nature of PCN-808-BDBR allows for the diffusion of large substituents into the mesopores, making it suitable for photocatalytic reactions that involve large substituents, unlike microporous MOFs which may be inaccessible for such substituents.",

      "question": "How does the linker ratio of TPTB:BPDC in PCN-808-BPDC compare between the single crystal structure and the 1H NMR of digested samples?",
      "answer": "The linker ratio of TPTB:BPDC in PCN-808-BPDC is about 2:1 according to the single crystal structure, but it is approximately 1:1 according to the 1H NMR of digested samples.",

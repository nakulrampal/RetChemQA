      "answer": "Hexafluoroacetylacetonate (Facac−) and acetylacetonate (Acac−) ligands are introduced to modify the steric and electronic environment near the Ni(II) active site of Ni-AIM-NU-1000, which modulates its activity and/or catalytic chemical selectivity, leading to a remarkable increase in product selectivity for C4 (butene) species with a strong preference for the 1-butene isomer.",

      "question": "What structural changes occur upon the introduction of Facac− and Acac− ligands to the NU-1000 framework, according to single-crystal X-ray diffraction data?",
      "answer": "Single-crystal X-ray diffraction data revealed that upon the introduction of Facac− and Acac− ligands to the NU-1000 framework, each Facac− anion chelates a single Zr ion, pointing towards the hexagonal channels and towards pores perpendicular to the c-axis. This modification suggests a change in the coordination environment of the Zr6 nodes, potentially affecting the electronic and steric properties of the active sites.",

      "question": "How does the presence of Facac− and Acac− ligands influence the electronic properties of the Zr6 nodes in the NU-1000 framework?",
      "answer": "The presence of Facac− and Acac− ligands influences the electronic properties of the Zr6 nodes in the NU-1000 framework by altering the charge distribution. CM5 charge analysis indicated that the introduction of these ligands leads to a more positive charge on the Zr atoms and a decrease in the total charges for the (μ3-O)4(μ3-OH)4 and (HCOO−)8 groups, suggesting electron flow from the Zr6 node to the Facac− ligands, which is consistent with XPS results.",

      "question": "What is the significance of the Gibbs free energy profiles in understanding the selectivity of Ni-AIM-NU-1000 derivatives towards 1-butene production?",
      "answer": "The Gibbs free energy profiles are significant in understanding the selectivity of Ni-AIM-NU-1000 derivatives towards 1-butene production as they provide insights into the energetically favorable pathways for ethylene dimerization. These profiles illustrate that the presence of Facac− and Acac− ligands increases the activation barrier for the C–C coupling step, making the production of 1-butene more favorable than chain growth to longer oligomers, thereby explaining the enhanced selectivity observed experimentally.",

      "answer": "The atomic layer deposition (ALD) process plays a crucial role in the synthesis of Ni-Facac-AIM-NU-1000 and Ni-Acac-AIM-NU-1000 materials by enabling the precise and uniform introduction of Facac− and Acac− ligands, as well as Ni ions, onto the Zr6 nodes of the NU-1000 framework. This controlled deposition method ensures the saturation of active sites on Zr6 nodes with the desired ligands and Ni ions, leading to well-defined modifications that influence the catalytic activity and selectivity of the resulting materials.",

      "answer": "The structural and electronic modifications induced by Facac− and Acac− ligands affect the catalytic activity of Ni-AIM-NU-1000 for ethylene oligomerization by altering the steric and electronic environment around the Ni(II) active sites. These changes lead to an increase in the activation barrier for the C–C coupling step, resulting in a decrease in overall catalytic activity but a significant enhancement in selectivity towards the formation of C4 (butene) species, particularly favoring the production of 1-butene over longer oligomers.",

      "answer": "Computational modeling and energy decomposition analysis provide insights into the influence of Facac− and Acac− ligands on the catalytic mechanism of Ni-AIM-NU-1000 by showing how these ligands affect the binding energy of ethylene to Ni ethyl species and the energy required for structural deformation along the C–C coupling reaction pathways. These analyses reveal that the ligands contribute to a stronger binding of substrate to Ni and greater costs for structural deformation, which in turn affects the activation barriers for key steps in the catalytic cycle, ultimately influencing the activity and selectivity of the catalyst.",

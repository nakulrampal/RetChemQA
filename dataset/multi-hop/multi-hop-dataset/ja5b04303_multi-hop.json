      "question": "What is the effect of applying mechanical stress on the nonphotomagnetic compound FeNb?",
      "answer": "Applying mechanical stress on the nonphotomagnetic compound FeNb enforces a magnetic response to light, leading to light-induced magnetization.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the magnetic behavior of FeNb under high pressure compare to its manganese(II) analogue MnNb?",
      "answer": "Under high pressure, FeNb exhibits pressure-induced and thermal-induced spin-crossover transitions and photomagnetism, unlike MnNb which does not show spin-crossover or related photomagnetic phenomena.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the pressure-induced spin-crossover transition in FeNb reversible?",
      "answer": "Yes, the pressure-induced spin-crossover transition in FeNb is reversible, as confirmed by structural analyses after releasing the pressure.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does the LIESST effect play in the photomagnetic behavior of FeNb under high pressure?",
      "answer": "The LIESST effect enables the switching between low-spin and high-spin states of FeNb under high pressure, contributing to its photomagnetic behavior.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the structural change in FeNb under pressure compare to MnNb?",
      "answer": "FeNb undergoes significant structural changes under pressure, including volume compression and Fe–N bond shrinkage indicative of HS–LS spin-crossover transition, whereas MnNb experiences less pronounced structural changes without spin-crossover.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The photomagnetic effect observed in FeNb under pressure is due to the structural restraint of the FeII sites at higher pressures.",
      "answer": "False, the photomagnetic effect observed in FeNb under pressure is not due to the structural restraint of the FeII sites at higher pressures; it is due to the LIESST effect and the pressure-induced spin-crossover transition.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What experimental techniques were used to confirm the pressure-induced spin-crossover in FeNb?",
      "answer": "Single-crystal X-ray diffraction (sc-XRD) structural analysis under pressure and high-pressure Raman spectroscopy were used to confirm the pressure-induced spin-crossover in FeNb.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the magnetic ordering temperature of MnNb change with applied pressure?",
      "answer": "The magnetic ordering temperature of MnNb increases linearly with applied pressure, indicating strengthening antiferromagnetic interactions.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The piezochromic behavior of FeNb is caused by irreversible CN-bridge isomerization.",
      "answer": "False, the piezochromic behavior of FeNb is caused by the pressure-induced ligand field change at the FeII centers and the pressure-induced spin-crossover transition, not by irreversible CN-bridge isomerization.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the photomagnetic measurements performed for FeNb under pressure?",
      "answer": "The photomagnetic measurements for FeNb under pressure demonstrated the first pressure-induced spin-crossover photomagnet, revealing that complex magnetic behavior can be induced by adjusting thermodynamic conditions.",

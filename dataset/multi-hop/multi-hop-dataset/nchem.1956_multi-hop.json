      "question": "What is the main challenge in duplicating the reactivity of enzymatic iron-oxo species in synthetic systems?",
      "answer": "The main challenge in duplicating the reactivity of enzymatic iron-oxo species in synthetic systems is the instability of the terminal iron-oxo moiety, along with steric and electronic factors that limit the activity of previously reported mononuclear iron(IV)-oxo compounds.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What unique properties do metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) offer for supporting isolated terminal iron-oxo species?",
      "answer": "MOFs offer high surface area, permanent porosity, chemical and thermal stability, and synthetic tunability, making them appealing for supporting isolated terminal iron-oxo species.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the coordination environment in MOFs differ from that in molecular iron(IV)-oxo complexes, and what impact does this have?",
      "answer": "In MOFs, iron cations are often ligated by weaker-field ligands, such as carboxylates and aryl oxides, which are constrained in their coordination position by the extended framework structure. This unique coordination environment may impart novel electronic properties and reactivity to terminal oxos in MOFs, different from those in molecular iron(IV)-oxo complexes.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What experimental evidence supports the formation of an iron(IV)-oxo intermediate in the reaction of Fe2(dobdc) with N2O?",
      "answer": "The formation of an iron(III)-hydroxide product from a reaction that employs a two-electron oxidant strongly suggests the intermediacy of an iron(IV)-oxo species. Additionally, the appearance of new bands in the infrared spectrum assigned as Fe-OH and O-H vibrations, which shift when 18O is used, supports the formation of an iron(IV)-oxo intermediate.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the high-spin S=2 ground state predicted for the iron(IV)-oxo species in Fe2(dobdc)?",
      "answer": "The high-spin S=2 ground state predicted for the iron(IV)-oxo species in Fe2(dobdc) is significant because it matches the electronic configuration of nature's non-heme iron(IV)-oxo compounds, which are known for their reactivity in activating strong C-H bonds. This suggests that the iron(IV)-oxo species in Fe2(dobdc) may exhibit similar reactivity, despite the challenges in achieving this electronic configuration in a molecular species.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The iron(III)-hydroxide species formed in Fe2(dobdc) after reaction with N2O is incapable of activating weak C-H bonds.",
      "answer": "False",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"

    {
      "question": "What reaction products are formed when Fe0.1Mg1.9(dobdc) is exposed to N2O and ethane?",
      "answer": "When Fe0.1Mg1.9(dobdc) is exposed to N2O and ethane, the reaction products formed are ethanol and acetaldehyde.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why was a magnesium-diluted analogue, Fe0.1Mg1.9(dobdc), used in the oxidation of ethane?",
      "answer": "A magnesium-diluted analogue, Fe0.1Mg1.9(dobdc), was used in the oxidation of ethane to avoid oligomerization and overoxidation by diluting the reactive iron(II) sites with redox-inactive magnesium(II) centres, thus potentially reducing the proximity of reactive iron centres.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The iron-based MOFs Fe2(dobdc) and Fe0.1Mg1.9(dobdc) are capable of supporting fleeting iron(IV)-oxo species with an S=1 spin state.",
      "answer": "False",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What challenges do terminal iron-oxo species face outside of a protective protein superstructure?",
      "answer": "Outside of a protective protein superstructure, terminal iron-oxo species face challenges such as susceptibility to dimerization, forming oxo-bridged diiron complexes, intramolecular ligand oxidation, and solvent oxidation.",

      "question": "What are the synthesis conditions for CD-MOF-1?",
      "answer": "γ-CD (1.30 g, 1 mmol) and KOH (450 mg, 8 mmol) were dissolved in H2O (20 mL), filtered, and MeOH was allowed to vapor diffuse into the solution for one week to form colorless cubic crystals.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How was the elemental analysis data for CD-MOF-1 interpreted in terms of solvent composition?",
      "answer": "The elemental analysis data for CD-MOF-1 corresponds to 22% solvent composition by weight percentage, which is commensurate with the TGA data showing a weight loss of ca. 22% at 100 ºC.",
      "difficulty": "hard",

      "question": "Is the preparation of edible CD-MOF-1 different from that of CD-MOF-1?",
      "answer": "Yes, edible CD-MOF-1 is prepared using food-grade potassium benzoate and γ-CD dissolved in distilled water, followed by vapor diffusion of Everclear grain alcohol.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"

    {
      "question": "What method was used to measure the presence of counterions quantitatively in CD-MOFs?",
      "answer": "1H NMR spectroscopy of D2O solutions of redissolved samples of CD-MOFs was used to measure the presence of counterions quantitatively.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"

    {
      "question": "What was the purpose of soaking CD-MOF-2 crystals in a saturated solution of 4-phenylazophenol in CH2Cl2?",
      "answer": "The purpose was to observe the uptake of small molecules from CH2Cl2 solution by CD-MOF-2 crystals.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How was the thermal stability and activation of CD-MOF-1 and CD-MOF-2 achieved?",
      "answer": "By immersing as-synthesized samples in CH2Cl2 for three days, refreshing the CH2Cl2 three times, and then evacuating the samples at room temperature for 10 h, followed by 45 °C for 12 h.",
      "difficulty": "hard",

    {
      "question": "True or False: The crystallographic data for CD-MOFs prepared from Na2CO3, K2CO3, KF, and K2(4,4′-azobenzene-dicarboxylate) were not refined to a standard suitable for publication.",

    {
      "question": "What was the result of co-crystallizing CD-MOF-2 with Rhodamine B?",
      "answer": "Deep red crystals were obtained, indicating the inclusion of Rhodamine B within the CD-MOF-2 framework.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What does the presence of 50% of the benzoate anions in the framework of edible CD-MOF-1 suggest about its structure?",
      "answer": "It suggests that the ordering of the observed benzoate counterions causes the cubic symmetry of the unit cell to be commuted, while the underlying MOF structure remains unaffected.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The structures of CD-MOFs are influenced by the presence of counterions, as evidenced by the different crystal habits observed in CD-MOF-3 and CD-MOF-4.",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"

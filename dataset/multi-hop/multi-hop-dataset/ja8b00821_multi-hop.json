      "question": "What is the role of silica in the rearrangement of cycloheptene 2d to cyclohexene 3d?",
      "answer": "Silica acts as a catalyst to facilitate the rearrangement of cycloheptene 2d to cyclohexene 3d, leading to the formation of bromohexene 3d as the only product.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the use of zinc(II) chloride affect the rearrangement of 2d to 3d compared to using silica?",
      "answer": "The use of zinc(II) chloride in the rearrangement of 2d to 3d results in the formation of bromohexene 3d and a small amount of diastereomer 4d, indicating that zinc(II) chloride can promote the reaction but also leads to side products.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What evidence suggests that a radical pathway is not involved in the rearrangement of 2d to 3d when using zinc(II) chloride?",
      "answer": "The lack of change in the reaction profile when a radical scavenger (BHT) is added suggests that a radical pathway is not involved in the rearrangement of 2d to 3d using zinc(II) chloride.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the effect of using different equivalents of zinc(II) chloride on the rearrangement of 2d to 3d?",
      "answer": "Using different equivalents of zinc(II) chloride affects the rate of the rearrangement of 2d to 3d and the formation of side products. Higher equivalents increase the reaction rate and the formation of diastereomer 4d, while catalytic amounts also promote the reaction but at a slower rate.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the presence of zinc(II) chloride lead to the formation of side products in the rearrangement of 2d to 3d?",
      "answer": "The presence of zinc(II) chloride leads to the formation of side products in the rearrangement of 2d to 3d by reacting with the rearranged product 3d, as indicated by the observation of side products 4d and Cl-4d when pure cyclohexene 3d is subjected to zinc(II) chloride.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can the rearrangement of 2d to 3d occur with Brønsted acids, and how does the rate compare to using silica or zinc(II) chloride?",
      "answer": "The rearrangement of 2d to 3d can occur with Brønsted acids, such as acetic acid, but at a very slow rate compared to using silica or zinc(II) chloride.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The rearrangement of cycloheptene 2d to cyclohexene 3d is solely dependent on the use of silica as a catalyst.",
      "answer": "False. The rearrangement can also be facilitated by zinc(II) chloride and organic Lewis and Brønsted acids, although the outcomes and rates may vary.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The addition of a radical scavenger has no effect on the rearrangement process of 2d to 3d when using zinc(II) chloride.",
      "answer": "True. The addition of a radical scavenger like BHT does not change the reaction profile, indicating a radical pathway is not involved.",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: Higher equivalents of zinc(II) chloride do not affect the formation of side products in the rearrangement of 2d to 3d.",
      "answer": "False. Higher equivalents of zinc(II) chloride increase the formation of side products such as diastereomer 4d.",

      "question": "True or False: The rearrangement of 2d to 3d cannot occur in the presence of Brønsted acids.",
      "answer": "False. The rearrangement can occur with Brønsted acids like acetic acid, although at a slower rate compared to using silica or zinc(II) chloride.",

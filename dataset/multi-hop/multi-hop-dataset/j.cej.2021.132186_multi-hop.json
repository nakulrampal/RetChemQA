      "question": "What are the synthesis conditions for CMA-1?",
      "answer": "CMA-1 was synthesized by dissolving 0.4954 g (5.0 mmol) MAT and 0.8524 g (5.0 mmol) CuCl2·2H2O in 15.0 mL of deionized water and heating to 70 °C under vigorous stirring. Then, 0.6500 g (10.0 mmol) of NaN3 in 5.0 mL of water was added dropwise for 30 min. After stirring at 70 °C for another 10 min, black precipitates were filtered, washed with water and ethanol, and dried in the air.",

    {
      "question": "What are the key properties that make CMA-2 a promising candidate for new-generation initiating explosive?",
      "answer": "CMA-2's key properties include its nontoxic metal (Cu), high nitrogen content (62.5%), high thermal decomposition temperature (213.4 °C), good sensitivities (impact sensitivity = 1.0 J; friction sensitivity = 5 N; electrostatic spark sensitivity = 43.5 mJ), powerful ignition capability (minimum primary charge = 10 mg), and simple synthesis.",

    {
      "question": "How does the introduction of hydrogen bonding in CMA-1 and CMA-2 improve their stability and safety?",
      "answer": "The introduction of hydrogen bonding in CMA-1 and CMA-2 improves their stability and safety by enhancing the strength of the system, leading to improved thermal stability and reduced mechanical and electrostatic sensitivities. These hydrogen bonds absorb energy to delay or avoid the breaking of coordination and covalent bonds, thus enhancing molecular stability and material safety.",

    {
      "question": "What is the role of 1-methyl-5-aminotetrazole (MAT) in the synthesis of CMA-1 and CMA-2?",
      "answer": "1-methyl-5-aminotetrazole (MAT) acts as an NH2-substituted ligand in the synthesis of CMA-1 and CMA-2, contributing to the formation of hydrogen bonds that stabilize the copper(II)-azide system and improve the materials' thermal stability and sensitivities.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "Compare the electrostatic spark sensitivity (EDS) of CMA-1 and the original CA powder.",
      "answer": "The electrostatic spark sensitivity (EDS) of CMA-1 is 201.6 mJ, which is at least 720 times higher than that of the original CA powder (<0.28 mJ), making CMA-1 a promising candidate for new-generation initiating explosive.",

    {
      "question": "True or False: The thermal decomposition temperature of CMA-1 is higher than that of pure CA powder.",

      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What experimental techniques were used to confirm the presence of hydrogen bonds in CMA-1?",
      "answer": "The presence of hydrogen bonds in CMA-1 was confirmed using atoms-in-molecules (AIM) theory and noncovalent interactions (NCI) plots calculated based on electron density and its reduced gradient.",

    {
      "question": "What is the minimum primary charge (MPC) required for CMA-1 and CMA-2 to reliably detonate RDX?",
      "answer": "The minimum primary charge (MPC) required for both CMA-1 and CMA-2 to reliably detonate RDX is 10 mg.",

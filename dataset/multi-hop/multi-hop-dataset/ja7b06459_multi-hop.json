      "question": "What is the impact of substituent variation on the chemical stability of MOFs as demonstrated in the synthesis of H5L1, H5L2, and H5L3?",
      "answer": "The chemical stability of MOFs can be tuned by modifying the ligand structures, as demonstrated in the synthesis of H5L1, H5L2, and H5L3. Specifically, the MOF with bulky electron-withdrawing 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl) phenyl groups (H5L1) exhibited enhanced tolerance to water, weak acid, and base compared to MOFs with less bulky or less electron-withdrawing substituents (H5L2 and H5L3).",

Lower temperatures (0 °C) were found to be optimal for achieving high enantioselectivity and yields. This suggests that temperature control is crucial for optimizing the reaction conditions to achieve the desired catalytic performance.",

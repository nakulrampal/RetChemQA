      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of using MOFs to stabilize unusual intermediates in chemical reactions?",
      "answer": "MOFs provide a unique, rigid environment that can stabilize unusual intermediates, potentially leading to new insights into reaction mechanisms and the development of novel catalysts.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The incorporation of the photoactive unit within the MOF structure leads to the formation of a 3MLCT excited state as the dominant photoinduced excited state.",

      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What experimental techniques were used to characterize the photoactivity of Mn(diimine)(CO)3Br within the MOF?",
      "answer": "Time-resolved infrared measurements, single-crystal X-ray diffraction, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the MOF environment affect the photophysical properties of Re(diimine)(CO)3Cl complexes?",
      "answer": "The MOF environment leads to the formation of a p2p* excited state, rather than the 3MLCT excited state commonly observed in solution, suggesting a gas-phase-like environment.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The study provides the first example of a photoinduced reaction observed crystallographically in a metal-organic framework.",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role do Mn(II) cations play in the structure of the metal-organic frameworks discussed?",
      "answer": "Mn(II) cations act as nodes in the MOF structure, connecting the organic linkers to form a three-dimensional framework.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "Describe the process and significance of fac- to mer-isomerization within the MOF structure as observed in the study.",
      "answer": "Fac- to mer-isomerization is photoinduced within the MOF structure, demonstrating the framework's ability to facilitate and stabilize structural changes in photoactive molecules, which is significant for understanding and controlling photochemical reactions.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"

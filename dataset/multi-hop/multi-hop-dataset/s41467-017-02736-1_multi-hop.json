    {
      "question": "What is the main goal of the synthesis approach reported in the manuscript?",
      "answer": "The main goal is to achieve sequence-controlled radical copolymerization using the regular structure of a porous coordination polymer (PCP) as a template, to transcribe the PCP's periodic structure into the product at the molecular level.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the key components used in the synthesis of periodic copolymers in the study?",
      "answer": "The key components are a styrenic derivative containing two carboxylic acid groups (S) periodically immobilized in the nanochannels of a porous coordination polymer (PCP), and acrylonitrile (A) as a host comonomer.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the synthesis approach ensure the sequence regulation of the copolymers?",
      "answer": "The sequence regulation is ensured by the periodic immobilization of the styrenic derivative (S) in the nanochannels of the PCP, which, when copolymerized with acrylonitrile (A), leads to a copolymer with a predominant repetitive SAAA sequence.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What analytical methods were suggested by Reviewer #1 for a deeper analysis of the formed copolymers?",
      "answer": "Reviewer #1 suggested using advanced chromatography techniques or mass spectrometry for a deeper analysis of the formed copolymers.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why were mass spectrometry techniques not applicable for the sequence analysis of the obtained copolymer according to the authors?",
      "answer": "Mass spectrometry techniques were not applicable due to several inherent problems, such as the carbonization of acrylonitrile units by heating, low solubility of the copolymer in common organic solvents, and the high molecular weight of the polymer which prevented analysis due to lower resolution in the higher molecular weight region.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What new data did the authors obtain from additional experiments that supported the formation of periodic SAAA sequence in the resulting copolymer?",
      "answer": "The authors obtained new data showing that the monomer composition of the generated copolymers was close to that of P1 (A/S = 3:1), independent of the monomer feed ratio, and study on the triad structures using 13C NMR spectroscopy showed that SAAA repetitive sequence is predominantly formed.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the periodic copolymer synthesized in the study considered a significant progress beyond the state-of-the-art according to Reviewer #1?",
      "answer": "False. Reviewer #1 mentioned that a periodic copolymer by itself is not a huge progress beyond the state-of-the-art and suggested that immobilizing more than one monomer in the network for the synthesis of diperiodic or triperiodic copolymers would be a significant achievement.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "Did the authors successfully demonstrate the scalability and yield of their copolymerization approach?",
      "answer": "True. The authors mentioned that they have successfully performed gram-scale reactions using PCPs, producing a sufficient amount of polymers, and also demonstrated that the PCP could be re-generated after reaction.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What was the outcome of attempting radical copolymerization of butadiene with the styryl monomer in the channels of 1S?",
      "answer": "The attempt to perform radical copolymerization of butadiene with the styryl monomer in the channels of 1S did not result in the formation of homo- and co-polymer, probably because of the decrease in the reactivity of the monomer in the narrow pores.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How did the authors address the fundamental limitation of not forming an exclusively SAAA repetitive sequence in the copolymer?",
      "answer": "The authors acknowledged that the copolymer predominantly formed an SAAA repetitive sequence but not exclusively, indicating that every copolymer must have some error sequences whatever the methodology is.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"

      "question": "How was the photochromic behavior of the MON-ormosil composite film investigated?",
      "answer": "The photochromic behavior was investigated by irradiating the film with 350 nmâ€“UV lamps for 2-3 minutes at room temperature and recording the UV-vis absorption spectrum immediately.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What was the outcome of the leaching experiment with the DP linker-doped ormosil film?",
      "answer": "The DP linker slowly leaches out of the ormosil film when immersed in ethanol, as evidenced by the appearance of p* absorption bands typical of the DP linker in the UV-vis absorption spectra of the ethanolic solution.",

      "question": "What was the purpose of using PLATON/SQUEEZE in the refinement of Cd-TP and Zn-DA crystal structures?",
      "answer": "PLATON/SQUEEZE was used to account for the contribution of a disordered solvent to the calculated structure factors by back-Fourier transformation of the continuous density found in the masked region of the difference map.",

    {
      "question": "What does the decrease in the mean particle size of the material with increasing ultrasonication time, as observed in DLS experiments, suggest about the exfoliation process?",
      "answer": "The decrease in the mean particle size with increasing ultrasonication time suggests that the exfoliation process effectively delaminates the aggregated 2D sheets, leading to thinner stacks of 2D MONs.",

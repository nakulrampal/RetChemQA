    },
    {
      "question": "How does the energy transfer between PdTCPP and the molecular motor facilitate the motor's rotation?",
      "answer": "The energy transfer from the PdTCPP photosensitizer to the molecular motor facilitates the motor's rotation by enabling the photoisomerization of the molecular motor under visible light, which drives its rotary motion.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What was the effect of solvent-assisted linker exchange on the structure of the MOF?",
      "answer": "The solvent-assisted linker exchange (SALE) led to the replacement of DPG pillars with the bispyridyl molecular motor in the MOF structure, resulting in an expansion of the elementary cell in the c-direction, which was confirmed by PXRD.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What challenges were encountered during the SC-XRD analysis of the motorized MOF?",
      "answer": "During the SC-XRD analysis of the motorized MOF, challenges such as severe disorder in the structure and the presence of disordered solvent, which led to a lower two-theta maximum and difficulty in obtaining high-quality data, were encountered.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"

    {
      "question": "Is the rotation of the molecular motor in the MOF framework reversible?",
      "answer": "Yes, the rotation of the molecular motor in the MOF framework is reversible, as indicated by the ability to perform irradiation/thermal relaxation steps over multiple cycles without noticeable fatigue or photodegradation.",

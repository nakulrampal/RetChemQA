    {
      "question": "What is the impact of reducing the amount of HCl used in the synthesis on the availability of free COOH groups in the MOF?",
      "answer": "Reducing the amount of HCl leads to the formation of a product where all carboxylic groups are engaged in network formation through coordination and hydrogen bonding, making them unavailable as free binding sites.",

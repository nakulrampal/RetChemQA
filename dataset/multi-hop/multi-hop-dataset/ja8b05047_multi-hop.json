      "question": "What is the purpose of designing a photocleavable dianthracene-based ligand in the context of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs)?",
      "answer": "The purpose is to create a class of tridimensional light-degradable MOFs that can be disassembled on-demand through light irradiation or temperature increase, potentially overcoming limitations in drug delivery applications.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the photocleavable nature of the ligand contribute to the controlled disassembly of the MOF?",
      "answer": "The photocleavable nature of the ligand allows for the controlled disassembly of the MOF through the reversible 4π-4π photodimerization mechanism, where light irradiation above 350 nm forms rigid photodimers and wavelengths below 300 nm induce photocleavages.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the triggers used for the degradation of CD-MOF-161, and how do they affect its structure?",
      "answer": "The triggers used for the degradation of CD-MOF-161 are light irradiation (254 and 266 nm) and a rise in temperature (160 °C). These triggers lead to the photocleavage of Di-9AC in the CD-MOF-161 structure, causing it to fall apart.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What experimental techniques were used to characterize the Di-9AC ligand and the CD-MOF-161 structure?",
      "answer": "The Di-9AC ligand and the CD-MOF-161 structure were characterized using techniques such as 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, UV–vis and FTIR absorbance spectroscopies, single-crystal X-ray diffraction, and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD).",

    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the dinuclear clusters in the structure of CD-MOF-161?",
      "answer": "The dinuclear clusters in the structure of CD-MOF-161 serve as secondary building units that are interconnected to form a 3D network, contributing to the MOF's structural integrity and its ability to incorporate and release molecules in a controlled manner.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the incorporation of fluorescein into CD-MOF-161 demonstrate its potential for drug delivery applications?",
      "answer": "The incorporation of fluorescein into CD-MOF-161 demonstrates its potential for drug delivery applications by showing that its pores can be loaded with molecules, and the crystalline structure remains unchanged, indicating the MOF's ability to carry and release therapeutic agents.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What role does the temperature play in the cleavage of Di-9AC, and how does it compare to light-induced cleavage?",
      "answer": "Temperature plays a role in the cleavage of Di-9AC by inducing thermocleavage at 130 °C, leading to its gradual degradation into 9AC monomer. This process is more controlled and produces no byproducts compared to light-induced cleavage, which shows faster degradation kinetics but generates byproducts.",

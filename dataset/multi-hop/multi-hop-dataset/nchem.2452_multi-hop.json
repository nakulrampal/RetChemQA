      "question": "What is the maximum observed rate acceleration for the Kemp elimination reaction catalyzed by the [Co8L12]16+ coordination cage?",
      "answer": "2 × 105-fold",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the rate of the catalyzed Kemp elimination reaction change with pD in the range 8.5–11.4?",
      "answer": "The rate of the catalyzed reaction is independent of pD in the range 8.5–11.4.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What method was used to measure the rate constant for the Kemp elimination reaction in the presence of the cage?",

    {
      "question": "What is the role of chloride ions in the experiment involving the Kemp elimination reaction catalyzed by the [Co8L12]16+ coordination cage?",
      "answer": "Chloride ions were added to compete for the sites on the cage surface, reducing the observed rate of reaction to that of the background rate.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the cage being highly positively charged (16+) in the context of catalyzing the Kemp elimination reaction?",
      "answer": "The high positive charge of the cage leads to the accumulation of partially desolvated hydroxide ions around its surface, which increases the local concentration of hydroxide ions and their reactivity, contributing to the catalytic activity.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The catalytic activity of the [Co8L12]16+ coordination cage for the Kemp elimination reaction is due to the stabilization of the transition state by the interior of the cage.",

      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The product of the Kemp elimination reaction, 2-cyanophenolate, binds strongly to the [Co8L12]16+ coordination cage, facilitating catalytic turnover.",

      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "How many turnovers were demonstrated in the experiment with the [Co8L12]16+ coordination cage as a catalyst for the Kemp elimination reaction?",

      "question": "What experimental technique was used to confirm that the reaction occurs with the benzisoxazole being bound in the cage cavity?",
      "answer": "Competitive inhibition experiments with cycloundecanone, which prevented substrate binding in the cage cavity.",

      "question": "True or False: The reaction rate of the Kemp elimination in the presence of the [Co8L12]16+ coordination cage decreases with time due to product inhibition.",

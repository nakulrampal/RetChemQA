      "question": "What are the main environmental concerns addressed by the development of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) for capturing volatile organic compounds?",
      "answer": "The main environmental concerns addressed include air pollution, particularly 'haze air' pollution in urban areas, and the harmful effects of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX) on human health and climate change.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the key features of the metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) developed for capturing aromatic volatile organic compounds?",
      "answer": "The key features of the developed MOFs include high capture capacities for aromatic volatile organic compounds even at low pressure and high temperature, high stability, hydrophobicity, and the ability to capture trace benzene in humid air.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How do the developed MOFs compare with other benchmark materials in terms of benzene adsorption capacity?",
      "answer": "One of the developed MOFs, BUT-66, shows significantly higher benzene adsorption capacity than benchmark materials such as MCM-41, MIL-101(Cr), ZIF-8, PAF-1, and Carboxen 1000, especially at low pressure and high temperature.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does the single-crystal structure of the MOFs play in understanding their capture performance?",
      "answer": "The single-crystal structure of the MOFs and their guest-loaded phases provide insight into the capture performance by revealing distinct adsorption sites, multiple synergistic host-guest and guest-guest interactions, and adaptive local flexibility, which contribute to their high adsorption capacities.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What challenges do MOFs face in capturing aromatic VOCs in air, and how do the developed MOFs address these challenges?",
      "answer": "Challenges include instability in humid air, preference for water molecules over aromatic hydrocarbons, and difficulty in designing MOFs for effective adsorption of non-polar or weakly polar molecules. The developed MOFs address these challenges by being moisture stable, not highly hydrophilic, having pores of appropriate size and shape, and featuring hydrophobic pores and local flexibility.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The developed MOFs retain their single crystallinity after guest removal and inclusion, allowing for precise structure determination.",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the hydrophobicity of the MOFs' exterior and interior surfaces for their application in capturing VOCs?",
      "answer": "The hydrophobicity of the MOFs' exterior and interior surfaces is significant because it contributes to their ability to float on water surfaces, resist water adsorption, and preferentially adsorb hydrophobic hydrocarbon molecules over water molecules, enhancing their performance in capturing VOCs in humid conditions.",
      "difficulty": "medium",

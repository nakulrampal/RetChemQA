      "question": "What is the chemical formula of the synthesized bimodal microporous twofold interpenetrating network?",
      "answer": "{[Ni(bpe)2(N(CN)2)](N(CN)2)(5H2O)}n",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the two types of channels present in the synthesized network and what molecules do they accommodate?",
      "answer": "The synthesized network has a rectangular channel that accommodates free N(CN)−2 anions and a hexagonal channel that is occupied by water molecules.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the effect of exchanging N(CN)−2 anions with N3− anions on the framework?",
      "answer": "The exchange of N(CN)−2 anions with N3− anions leads to a dislocation of the mutual positions of the two interpenetrating frameworks, resulting in an increase in the effective pore size in one of the counterparts of the channels and a higher accommodation of adsorbate than in the as-synthesized framework.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the color change observed in the crystal upon dehydration and rehydration?",
      "answer": "The color change observed in the crystal upon dehydration and rehydration is significant because it indicates the retention of single crystallinity and the reversible structural transformation of the framework, which is unique among porous coordination polymers.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why were smaller anions such as N3−, NCO−, NO3−, and BF4− chosen for the anion exchange experiment?",
      "answer": "Smaller anions such as N3−, NCO−, NO3−, and BF4− were chosen for the anion exchange experiment because the dimensions of the channel are small and N(CN)−2 is almost a linear ligand, making it necessary to select anions that are smaller in size, shape, and symmetry for successful exchange.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The synthesized framework shows selective adsorption behavior towards different adsorbates.",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The synthesized framework loses its structural integrity upon guest molecule storage.",
      "answer": "False",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What property allows the synthesized framework to undergo size-, shape-, and symmetry-selective anion exchange?",
      "answer": "The synthesized framework can undergo size-, shape-, and symmetry-selective anion exchange due to its ability to selectively exchange the free N(CN)−2 anions with smaller anions, which is facilitated by the specific symmetries, shapes, and sizes of the channels within the framework.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of the twofold interpenetration in the synthesized framework?",
      "answer": "The twofold interpenetration in the synthesized framework plays a crucial role in maintaining structural integrity upon guest molecule storage and enabling a new type of porous functionality, such as the controllable gate-opening property.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The synthesized framework is capable of undergoing reversible structural transformations without losing its crystallinity.",
      "answer": "True",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"

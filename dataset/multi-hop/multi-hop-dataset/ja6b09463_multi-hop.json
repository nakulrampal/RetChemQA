      "question": "What is the primary purpose of synthesizing PCN-602?",
      "answer": "The primary purpose of synthesizing PCN-602 is to create a base-resistant metalloporphyrin metal-organic framework (MOF) that exhibits high catalytic activity for the C–H bond halogenation reaction in a basic system, significantly outperforming its homogeneous counterpart.",

      "question": "How does the window size of PCN-601 compare to that of PCN-602, and what implications does this have for catalytic performance?",
      "answer": "The window size of PCN-601 is smaller (∼2.1 × 8.0 Å) compared to PCN-602, which has a larger window size of 6.3 × 14.2 Å. This larger window size in PCN-602 improves catalytic performance by facilitating the diffusion of reactants and increasing the accessibility of active sites for substrates.",

      "question": "What role does the Mn3+-porphyrinic center play in PCN-602(Mn) and how does it compare to its homogeneous counterpart in catalytic reactions?",
      "answer": "The Mn3+-porphyrinic center in PCN-602(Mn) acts as a recyclable MOF catalyst, presenting high catalytic activity for the C–H bond halogenation reaction in a basic system. It significantly outperforms its homogeneous counterpart by preventing the formation of catalytically inactive dimers, thus making every porphyrin center highly active.",

      "question": "How does the stability of PCN-602 in solutions of coordinating anions compare to other MOFs like PCN-224(Co), PCN-222(Fe), and PCN-600(Mn)?",
      "answer": "PCN-602 exhibits excellent stability in solutions of coordinating anions (F–, CO32–, PO43–), unlike PCN-224(Co), PCN-222(Fe), and PCN-600(Mn), which show severe decomposition under the same conditions.",

    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the thermal stability of PCN-602 up to 280 °C?",
      "answer": "The significance of the thermal stability of PCN-602 up to 280 °C lies in its ability to withstand high temperatures without decomposing, which is crucial for its application in catalytic reactions that may require elevated temperatures.",

      "question": "What is the synthesis procedure for 1,4-di(1H-imidazol-1-yl)benzene used in the preparation of ZNU-4?",
      "answer": "A mixture of 1,4-dibromobenzene (4.718 g, 20 mmol), imidazole (3.404 g, 50 mmol), K2CO3 (11.057 g, 80 mmol), dimethylglycine (825.0 mg, 8 mmol) and CuI (761.8 mg, 4 mmol) were charged into a Schlenk flask. The system was then evacuated and back filled with N2 twice, followed by addition of 50 mL of DMSO. The mixture was heated at 110 °C for 48 h before it was partitioned between water and ethyl acetate. The organic layer was separated, and the aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate. The combined organic layers were washed with brine, dried over Na2SO4, and concentrated in vacuo. During the concentration process, white crystalline solid formed and the remaining yellow liquid (~ 10 mL) was difficult to remove under 50 °C. Then, the mixture was filtered and white solid was collected and dried under vacuum at room temperature for 2h. The purity of the obtained white solid was confirmed by 1H NMR. The weight was 2.544g. Yield: 61%.",

      "answer": "The static gas adsorption equilibrium measurements for ZNU-4 were performed on the Builder SSA 7000 instrument. Before gas adsorption measurements, the sample of ZNU-4 (~100 mg) was evacuated at 25 ºC for 2 h firstly, and then at 75 ºC for 10 h until the pressure dropped below 7 μmHg. The sorption isotherms were collected at 195K, 278K, and 298K on activated samples. The experimental temperatures were controlled by liquid acetone bath (195 K) and water bath (278 and 298 K), respectively.",

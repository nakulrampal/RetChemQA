      "question": "What is the primary method used for the synthesis of alkali dinitrosomethanides?",
      "answer": "The primary method used for the synthesis of alkali dinitrosomethanides involves starting from formamidinium nitrate, treating a methanolic solution of it and hydroxylammonium nitrate with a methanolic solution of KOtBu, resulting in the formation of N,N‘-dihydroxyformamidinium nitrate, which then reacts with MOtBu in the presence of oxygen to yield the alkali DNM salt.",

      "question": "How does the introduction of 18-crown-6 affect the structure of potassium dinitrosomethanide?",
      "answer": "The introduction of 18-crown-6 to potassium dinitrosomethanide leads to the observation of linear chains of repeating K(18-crown-6)[HC(NO)2] units in the solid state, instead of the three-dimensional network arrangement found without the crown ether.",

    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the planarity of the DNM anion in the context of its stability?",
      "answer": "The planarity of the DNM anion is significant because it indicates the presence of delocalization of a double bond over the whole anionic species, which likely contributes to the remarkable kinetic stability of the compound.",

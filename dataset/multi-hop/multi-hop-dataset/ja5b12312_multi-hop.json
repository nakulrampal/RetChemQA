      "answer": "MFM-130: H4LIV (50 mg, 0.093 mmol) and Cu(NO3)2·2.5H2O (0.17 g, 0.72 mmol) were dissolved in a mixture of N,N′-dimethylformamide (DMF, 6.0 mL) and H2O (0.5 mL), heated at 90 °C for 16 h. MFM-131: H4LV (50 mg, 0.078 mmol) and Cu(NO3)2·2.5H2O (145 mg, 0.622 mmol) were dissolved in a mixture of DMF (7.0 mL) and H2O (1.0 mL), heated at 85 °C for 48 h.",

      "question": "What are the key structural differences between MFM-130 and MFM-131?",
      "answer": "MFM-130 and MFM-131 both have fof-type non-interpenetrated networks with Kagomé lattice layers pillared by oligoparaxylene (OPX) linkers. MFM-130 contains four aromatic rings in its OPX linkers, while MFM-131 contains five. MFM-131's structure prevents network interpenetration due to the methyl substituents of the paraxylene units blocking the windows in the Kagomé lattice layer.",

    {
      "question": "What challenges were encountered in the structural analysis of MFM-131?",
      "answer": "The structural analysis of MFM-131 faced challenges due to the small size of available crystals, large fractional pore volume, and poor intensity and quality of diffraction data, resulting in low resolution and high discrepancy indices.",

      "question": "What is the main focus of the research described in the paper with DOI 10.1038/NCHEM.1871?",
      "answer": "The main focus of the research is on the synthesis and study of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) that incorporate peptide linkers, specifically focusing on how the side-chain control of porosity closure in these MOFs can be achieved through cooperative folding.",

      "question": "How do the researchers control the porosity and structural response of the MOFs to guests?",
      "answer": "The researchers control the porosity and structural response of the MOFs to guests by using peptides as linkers, where the sequence and type of amino acids in the peptides influence the MOF's behavior, including its ability to undergo ordered torsional changes and displacements in response to guest removal.",

      "question": "What are the key findings regarding the MOF Zn(GS)2 and its response to guest removal?",
      "answer": "The key findings regarding Zn(GS)2 indicate that it undergoes an ordered structural transformation from a solvated porous state to a desolvated non-porous state due to cooperative, displacive, and conformational changes of the peptide linkers, driven by hydrogen bonding involving the side-chain hydroxyl groups of the serine.",

      "question": "What role do the side-chain hydroxyl groups of serine play in the structural transformation of Zn(GS)2?",
      "answer": "The side-chain hydroxyl groups of serine play a crucial role in the structural transformation of Zn(GS)2 by participating in hydrogen bonding, which drives the cooperative folding and closure of the MOF's porosity upon guest removal.",

      "question": "How does the introduction of different amino acids in the peptide linkers affect the properties of the MOFs?",
      "answer": "The introduction of different amino acids in the peptide linkers affects the properties of the MOFs by altering the conformational space accessible to the peptide, which in turn influences the MOF's structural response to environmental changes, including guest removal, and enables the tuning of the MOF's functionality.",

      "DOI": "10.1038/NCHEM.1871",
      "question": "What is the significance of the cooperative folding mechanism observed in the MOFs studied?",
      "answer": "The significance of the cooperative folding mechanism observed in the MOFs is that it mimics protein folding processes, allowing for large-scale, ordered structural transformations in response to environmental changes. This mechanism enables the precise control of the MOF's porosity and functionality, potentially leading to applications in gas storage, separation, and catalysis.",

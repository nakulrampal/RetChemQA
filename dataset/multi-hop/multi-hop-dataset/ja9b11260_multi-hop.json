      "question": "What is the significance of minimal edge-transitive related nets in the design of MOFs?",
      "answer": "Minimal edge-transitive related nets are significant in the design of MOFs because they serve as suitable blueprints for the rational construction of highly coordinated MOFs. These nets, with their unique geometrical information, allow for the deliberate assembly of MOFs from net-coded building units (net-cBUs), facilitating the creation of materials with specific functionalities.",

      "answer": "The synthesis conditions of Y-kce-MOF-1 and Y-kex-MOF-1 differ in terms of the organic ligands used and the reaction temperatures. Y-kce-MOF-1 is synthesized using 1,2,4,5-tetrakis[3,5-bis(4-carboxyphenyl)phenoxymethyl]benzene as the organic ligand, while Y-kex-MOF-1 is synthesized using 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexakis[3,5-bis(4-carboxyphenyl)phenoxymethyl]benzene. Additionally, the reaction temperature for Y-kce-MOF-1 is 105°C, whereas for Y-kex-MOF-1, it is also 105°C but with a different ligand ratio and solvent conditions.",

      "answer": "The porosity of Tb-urx-MOF-1 was confirmed through low-pressure gas adsorption measurements using argon at 87K. The fully reversible type I isotherm obtained from these measurements, along with the calculated Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area and pore volume, provided evidence of the material's porosity.",

      "question": "What is the significance of using dimethylammonium cations in the synthesis of MOFs?",
      "answer": "Dimethylammonium cations are used in the synthesis of MOFs as structure-directing agents or counterions. They can influence the crystallization process, help stabilize the framework structure, and potentially affect the porosity and functionality of the resulting MOF by occupying void spaces within the framework.",

      "question": "How does the presence of Na+ cations affect the structure of Dy-urx-MOF-1?",
      "answer": "The presence of Na+ cations in Dy-urx-MOF-1, originating from the use of NaH2TTDA, affects the structure by coordinating to DMF and water molecules. These cations are localized at the axial positions of the RE-nonanuclear clusters, contributing to the overall stability and possibly influencing the connectivity and the porosity of the MOF.",

      "answer": "The challenges associated with the synthesis of MOFs using highly connected building blocks include achieving the desired connectivity and topology, controlling the porosity and functionality of the resulting framework, and ensuring the stability of the MOF under the synthesis conditions. Additionally, the complexity of the synthesis increases with the connectivity of the building blocks, making it difficult to predict and control the final structure of the MOF.",

      "question": "What is the significance of the high Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of activated MFM-185a?",
      "answer": "The high Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of activated MFM-185a, which is 4,734 m2 g−1, indicates that it has a very large surface area available for adsorption, making it highly effective for gas storage and separation applications.",

    {
      "question": "How does the design of octacarboxylate MOFs contribute to their gas adsorption properties?",
      "answer": "The design of octacarboxylate MOFs, involving selective elongation of metal-organic cages and high ligand connectivity, contributes to their gas adsorption properties by preventing interpenetration, ensuring robust structures with permanent porosity, and allowing efficient packing of gas molecules across a wide range of pressures.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the rotational dynamics of molecular rotors within MFM-180a-d16 and MFM-181a-d16 controlled solely by linker design?",
      "answer": "True. The rotational dynamics of molecular rotors within MFM-180a-d16 and MFM-181a-d16 are controlled solely by linker design, as demonstrated by the temperature-dependent 2H NMR studies which reveal the reorientation mechanisms and show that framework dynamics can be controlled by ligand design only.",

    {
      "question": "What role does the use of rigid, highly connected linkers play in the development of isoreticular porous materials?",
      "answer": "The use of rigid, highly connected linkers plays a crucial role in the development of isoreticular porous materials by providing a more robust and stable platform, which allows for the effective modulation of porosity and the creation of materials with high and predictable porosity.",

    {
      "question": "How does the selective elongation of tubular cages in MFM-185a contribute to its methane adsorption capacity?",
      "answer": "The selective elongation of tubular cages in MFM-185a contributes to its methane adsorption capacity by increasing the volumetric and gravimetric deliverable capacities, allowing MFM-185a to accommodate more methane at higher pressures due to its extended pore space.",

    {
      "question": "Does the presence of open metal sites in MFM-180a, 181a, 183a, and 185a frameworks indicate a selectivity for CO2 over CH4?",
      "answer": "True. The presence of open metal sites in MFM-180a, 181a, 183a, and 185a frameworks indicates a selectivity for CO2 over CH4, as these sites enable stronger interactions with CO2 due to its large quadrupole moment, leading to selective CO2 uptakes.",

      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the impact of linker elongation on the porosity and gas adsorption properties of the MFM-18X series?",
      "answer": "Linker elongation in the MFM-18X series impacts the porosity and gas adsorption properties by systematically increasing pore volumes and surface areas, enhancing both gravimetric and volumetric gas uptakes at high pressure without losing uptake in the low-pressure region.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can the rotational dynamics of molecular rotors in MOFs be elucidated through 2H NMR spectroscopy?",
      "answer": "True. The rotational dynamics of molecular rotors in MOFs can be elucidated through 2H NMR spectroscopy, as demonstrated by the studies on selectively deuterated MFM-180-d16 and MFM-181-d16, which reveal the reorientation mechanisms and rotational rates.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What challenges are associated with increasing porosity in MOFs through simple ligand elongation?",
      "answer": "Challenges associated with increasing porosity in MOFs through simple ligand elongation include potential increases in pore diameters that can weaken host–guest interactions at low surface coverage and often lead to framework interpenetration, reducing porosity and/or stability.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the design strategy of octacarboxylate MOFs avoid the drawbacks of simple ligand elongation?",
      "answer": "The design strategy of octacarboxylate MOFs avoids the drawbacks of simple ligand elongation by targeting the extension of specific dimensionalities and lengths, which allows for better control over porosity without compromising framework stability or host–guest interactions.",

      "question": "How was the H2L ligand synthesized?",
      "answer": "The H2L ligand was synthesized by dissolving 6,6'-dimethoxy-2,2'-bipyridine in a 33% HBr/HOAc solution, heating to reflux for 72 hours, filtering, washing with acetone, dispersing in boiling water, neutralizing with sodium hydroxide solution, filtering off, and drying.",

      "question": "What was the estimated turnover number (TON) for the electrocatalysis experiment and how was it calculated?",
      "answer": "The estimated TON for the electrocatalysis experiment was 400, calculated based on the analysis by Costentin et al. (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2012, 134, 11235) and using the peak position from SWV experiment as an estimate for the formal potential.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What was the role of the redox active L2- ligand in the catalytic cycle for water oxidation?",
      "answer": "The redox active L2- ligand played an important role in the second oxidation step from a Cu(III) species to an apparent 'Cu(IV)' species, serving as an electron transfer mediator in the catalytic cycle and responsible for the low overpotential observed.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What was the main reason for the higher ligand oxidation potential in the Cu-Lb complex compared to the 6,6'-substituted analogue?",
      "answer": "The higher ligand oxidation potential in the Cu-Lb complex compared to the 6,6'-substituted analogue was due to the second oxidation on ligand being approximately 0.2 V higher, which explains why Cu-Lb exhibits a higher overpotential for water oxidation.",

      "question": "What method was used to achieve the glassy state of the MOF from its crystalline form?",
      "answer": "The MOF was first perturbed by vapor hydration and thermal dehydration to give an amorphous state, which then undergoes a glass transition at 505 K into a super-cooled liquid.",

    {
      "question": "What are the main structural features of the c-Mn3 MOF that make it suitable for multi-stage transformations?",
      "answer": "The main structural features include a linear trinuclear metal node formed by pyridine and carboxylic acids that can be perturbed by water coordination, the presence of dangling linkers that increase configurational entropy in disordered states, and low porosity of 10.8% in a 2-fold interpenetrated framework.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the liquid fragility index mentioned in the study?",
      "answer": "The liquid fragility index, which is 105 for the MOF, is associated with the processibility of glass-forming liquid, indicating the MOF's high processibility.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does the presence of water vapor affect the MOF structure during the transformation process?",

    },
    {
      "question": "Why is the melt-quenching method not applicable for achieving glassy MOFs with cluster building units?",
      "answer": "The melt-quenching method is not applicable due to thermal decomposition of the MOFs with cluster building units prior to melting.",

    {
      "question": "What role does the flexibility of the MOF's linkers play in its structural transformations?",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does the temperature-time-transformation diagram (TTT) contribute to understanding the stability of the super-cooled liquid state?",
      "answer": "The TTT diagram verifies the good stability of the super-cooled liquid, which can sustain nearly 104 seconds at 510 K, above its Tg, indicating its potential for material processing.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of thermal dehydration in the transformation process of the MOF?",
      "answer": "Thermal dehydration is required to remove water after vapor hydration, completing the synergistic perturbation process and enabling the transition to a super-cooled liquid state.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the coordinative framework of the MOF contribute to its ability to recrystallize from the super-cooled liquid state?",
      "answer": "The coordinative framework, especially the metal-carboxylate cluster building units, has a profound structural directing effect for coordinative assembly, enabling recrystallization at high temperatures.",

      "question": "What is the maximum birefringence value achieved in the cyanurate system and which compound realizes it?",
      "answer": "The maximum birefringence value of 0.4 in the cyanurate system is realized by compound II.",

      "question": "What method is used for the SHG measurement of compounds III, IV, and V?",
      "answer": "The SHG measurement for compounds III, IV, and V was measured using the Q-switched Nd:YAG laser at 532 and 1064 nm via the Kurtz and Perry method.",

      "question": "What are the key steps in the decomposition process of compound I (HCYL)?",
      "answer": "The key steps in the decomposition process of compound I (HCYL) include: 1) Loss of 2H2O, 2) Formation of Li6(C3N3O3)2 and release of 3HNCO, 3) Decomposition to 3Li2(NCN) and release of 3CO2.",

      "question": "What is the significance of the angle (θ) between the maximum hyperpolarizability (βmax) vector and the crystal 2₁ polar axis in determining the SHG intensity of cyanurates?",
      "answer": "The SHG intensity of cyanurates varies with the angle (θ) between the maximum hyperpolarizability (βmax) vector and the crystal 2₁ polar axis. A smaller θ angle, indicating a closer alignment of the βmax vector with the polar axis, leads to stronger SHG responses.",

    {
      "question": "How does the coplanarity of the CY rings affect the birefringence in cyanurates?",
      "answer": "The birefringence in cyanurates depends on the coplanarity of the CY rings, explicitly described by a Boltzmann function. Maximum birefringence is achieved when the CY rings are perfectly coplanar with the crystal plane, indicated by a dihedral angle (γ) of 0°.",

      "question": "What is the significance of the hexakisfullerene derivative's design in the synthesis of the MOF?",
      "answer": "The hexakisfullerene derivative was designed with two pairs of phenyl pyridine groups attached to two methano-carbon atoms at trans-1 positions, making it an ideal ligand for forming an infinite number of layers upon coordination to metal ions due to the rectangular orientation of the pyridyl nitrogen atoms.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does the structure of the fullerene-linked MOF contribute to its potential applications?",

    {
      "question": "What challenges are associated with the synthesis of new MOFs, and how does the choice of metals and organic ligands impact the outcome?",
      "answer": "The synthesis of new MOFs is challenging due to the many choices of metals and organic ligands, which result in elaborate designs with interesting structures and properties.

    {
      "question": "How does the presence of noncoordinated hexakisfullerene molecules between the 2D MOF layers affect the structure?",
      "answer": "The presence of noncoordinated hexakisfullerene molecules between the 2D MOF layers results in a distance of 14.52 Å between Cd-linked 2D MOF layers and contributes to the expansion of the 2D network into a 3D system through interactions with the layers surrounding it.",

    {
      "question": "How does the coordination of compound 3 with cadmium ions lead to the formation of a fullerene-linked MOF?",
      "answer": "The coordination of compound 3 with cadmium ions occurs through the four pyridyl appendages of each fullerene unit to four cadmium ions, leading to the formation of a 2D fullerene-linked MOF with square and rectangular pores.",

    {
      "question": "What is the role of solvent molecules in the structure of the fullerene-linked MOF?",
      "answer": "Typically, solvent molecules are contained in the pores of the supramolecular cavities of 2D sheets with open porous networks, but in the network of the fullerene-linked MOF, solvent molecules are not observed in pore II due to the presence of bulky ethyl malonate groups.",

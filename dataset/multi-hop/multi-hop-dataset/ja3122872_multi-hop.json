      "question": "What is the purpose of postsynthetic modification in the synthesis of porous coordination polymers?",
      "answer": "The purpose of postsynthetic modification in the synthesis of porous coordination polymers is to enhance the mobility of guests, such as water molecules, within the channels of the polymer, thereby potentially improving the material's functionality, such as its ion conductivity.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why was LiCl chosen for the postsynthetic modification of the Ca2+ porous coordination polymer?",
      "answer": "LiCl was chosen for the postsynthetic modification because it is deliquescent in air, and the Cl– ion can act as a ligand to the Ca2+ site in dissociation, while the Li+ can interact with water molecules in the channel, enhancing H+ movement.",

    {
      "question": "What was the observed effect of adding LiCl to the Ca2+ porous coordination polymer on its H+ conductivity?",
      "answer": "The addition of LiCl to the Ca2+ porous coordination polymer resulted in a drastic enhancement of H+ movement in the 1D channels, achieving over 10–2 S cm–1 of ion conductivity at 25 °C and RH = 20–40%.",

    {
      "question": "How does the postsynthetic modification with LiCl affect the water adsorption capacity of the Ca2+ porous coordination polymer?",
      "answer": "The postsynthetic modification with LiCl increases the water adsorption capacity of the Ca2+ porous coordination polymer, allowing it to adsorb more water molecules per Ca2+ ion than the unmodified polymer at the same conditions.",

      "question": "Based on the synthesis conditions, why might other inorganic salts like LiBr and NaCl not be successful for postsynthetic reactions with the Ca2+ porous coordination polymer?",
      "answer": "Other inorganic salts like LiBr and NaCl might not be successful for postsynthetic reactions with the Ca2+ porous coordination polymer due to differences in ionic radii and the coordination strength of halogen anions, which could affect their interaction with the polymer structure and water molecules.",

    {
      "question": "What role does the Li+ ion play in enhancing the H+ conductivity within the channels of the modified Ca2+ porous coordination polymer?",
      "answer": "The Li+ ion enhances the H+ conductivity within the channels of the modified Ca2+ porous coordination polymer by interacting with water molecules, contributing to the dynamic motion and possibly facilitating the fast diffusion and enhanced conductivity of H+ ions.",

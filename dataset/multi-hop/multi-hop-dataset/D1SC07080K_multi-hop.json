      "question": "What is the relationship between the size of the A-site cation and the melting temperature (Tm) in hybrid organic-inorganic ABX3 structures?",
      "answer": "Increasing the size of the A-site cation from (C3H7)4N / (C4H9)4N / (C5H11)4N results in a decrease in Tm through an increase in DSf.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the replacement of the B-site transition metal cations affect the melting temperature in ABX3 structures?",
      "answer": "Consistent trends in Tm with metal replacement are observed with each A-site cation, with the trend being Co < Fe < Mn.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the effect of cooling the melts of hybrid organic-inorganic ABX3 structures?",
      "answer": "The majority of the melts formed were found to recrystallise partially upon cooling, though glasses could be formed through a small degree of organic linker decomposition.",

      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the tolerance factor in predicting the structure of ABX3 materials?",
      "answer": "The tolerance factor is used to predict whether a given chemical composition will form a cubic or a distorted structure, with values between 0.8 and 1.0 typically leading to perovskite structures.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The glass transition temperatures (Tg) of all melt-quenched ABX3 glasses are above room temperature.",
      "answer": "False. The low values of Tg (33 °C to -26 °C) are broadly consistent with both their low Tm values (185 °C to 106 °C) and the empirical 'Tg/Tm ≈ 2/3' law, indicating that some glasses have Tg below room temperature.",

      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does the size of the A-site cation play in the structural diversity of ABX3 materials?",
      "answer": "The size of the A-site cation influences the structural diversity of ABX3 materials by affecting the type of structure formed, such as perovskite, triple rutile, or LiSbO3 structures, and also impacts the melting temperature and glass transition temperature.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: Increasing the size of the A-site cation always leads to an increase in the melting temperature of ABX3 structures.",
      "answer": "False. Increasing the size of the A-site cation actually results in a decrease in the melting temperature through an increase in DSf.",

      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the chemical composition of ABX3 structures affect their potential applications?",
      "answer": "The chemical composition of ABX3 structures affects their potential applications by modulating their physical properties, such as melting temperature and glass transition temperature, which are crucial for applications in thermoelectrics and other optoelectronic devices.",

      "question": "What experimental methods are used to study the melting mechanism of ABX3 structures?",
      "answer": "Total scattering methods are used to provide a greater understanding of the melting mechanism of ABX3 structures.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"

    {
      "question": "True or False: The melting of ABX3 structures involves the breaking of M–N coordination bonds and the formation of under-coordinated M centers.",
      "answer": "True. The melting of ABX3 structures involves M–N coordination bond breaking and the formation of under-coordinated M centers.",

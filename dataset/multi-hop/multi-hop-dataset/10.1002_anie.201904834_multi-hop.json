    {
      "question": "Is the formation of cyclobutane rings through the [2++2] cycloaddition reaction strain-free?",
      "answer": "False. The formation of cyclobutane rings imposes strain into the structure, which can result in changes such as broken chains or the need for guest solvent molecules to relieve the strain.",

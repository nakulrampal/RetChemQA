    {
      "question": "How does the structural difference between 3aNa2 and 1a influence their respective motions?",
      "answer": "The structural difference, particularly the coordination of Na+ ions and the inclusion of porphyrin linkers in 3aNa2, influences its ability to perform unidirectional dual rotary and twisting motions, unlike 1a which exhibits reversible extension-contraction and twisting motion.",

    {
      "question": "Why was the reaction of 6b with NaBH4 unsuccessful in producing the desired helicate?",
      "answer": "The reaction of 6b with NaBH4 was unsuccessful due to the p-phenylene linkage in 6b, which likely hampers spiroborate formation considerably owing to steric hindrance.",

    {
      "question": "How do the optical properties of 3aNa2 change upon guest encapsulation and what does this indicate?",
      "answer": "Upon guest encapsulation, the CD spectra of 3aNa2 change significantly, indicating that the guest encapsulation induces chiroptical changes in the helicate due to the unidirectional dual rotary and twisting motions.",

    {
      "question": "How does the inclusion of electron-deficient aromatic guests influence the molecular motions of 3aNa2?",
      "answer": "The inclusion of electron-deficient aromatic guests in 3aNa2 triggers expansion of the bisporphyrin cavity, which is accompanied by a rotation of the porphyrin rings and a corresponding unidirectional twisting of the spiroborate helix.",

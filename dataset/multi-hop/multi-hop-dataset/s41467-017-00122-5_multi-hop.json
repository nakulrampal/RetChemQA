      "question": "How does the structural flexibility of the porous framework contribute to the photochemical electrocyclization?",
      "answer": "The structural flexibility of the porous framework enables highly efficient photochemical electrocyclization in a single-crystal-to-single-crystal manner by maintaining sufficient room for structural changes of DTE moieties for quantitative conversion, with the release of strain through the framework structural change upon photoisomerization.",

      "question": "What role does CO2 play in the research, and how is its sorption affected by light irradiation?",
      "answer": "CO2 acts as a molecular probe to demonstrate the flexible nature of the twofold interpenetrated frameworks. Its sorption on the porous crystal at 195 K is reversibly modulated by light irradiation, showcasing the framework's ability to undergo quantitative and reversible isomerization upon UV and visible light irradiation, which is applicable to reversible photomodulation of its gas sorption properties.",

      "question": "What are the challenges in developing solid-state photoresponsive materials as mentioned in the article?",
      "answer": "The challenges include the lack of intrinsic structural flexibility available to release stress and strain upon photochemical events, which hampers quantitative conversion in photochemical reactions in solids.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or False: The research successfully demonstrated a reversible photomodulation of CO2 sorption in a twofold interpenetrated photoreactive PCP containing a DTE-based ligand.",

      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the research address the issue of low photoisomerization efficiencies in crystalline states of DTE ligands?",
      "answer": "The research addresses this issue by designing a framework having flexibility, such that during photoisomerization, sufficient room is maintained for structural changes of DTE moieties for quantitative conversion, with the release of strain through the framework structural change upon photoisomerization.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"

      "question": "What is the difference in the BET area of NU-1200 before and after molybdenum deposition?",
      "answer": "The BET area decreased from 2620 to 2350 m2/g after molybdenum deposition.",

    {
      "question": "How does the presence of TEA affect the catalytic activity of Mo-NU-1200 in the oxidation of 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol?",
      "answer": "The presence of TEA dramatically decreases the conversion rate, from 100% conversion in 5 hours without TEA to 34 ± 4% conversion with TEA.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the molybdenum species in Mo-NU-1200 coordinated in an octahedral geometry before the catalytic reaction?",
      "answer": "True, one of the molybdenum modes (Mo1) is coordinated in an octahedral geometry to one terminal oxygen atom from the Zr6 node.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What structural change occurs to the molybdenum species on the Zr6 node of Mo-NU-1200 after the catalytic reaction in the absence of TEA?",
      "answer": "The two anchoring modes of the molybdenum species, Mo1 and Mo2, evolve into a single new mode (Mo3), where the molybdenum atom is coordinated to three oxygen atoms.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "factual"
    },
    {
      "question": "Does the oxidation state of molybdenum change after deposition in NU-1200?",
      "answer": "False, the oxidation state of molybdenum remains +6 after deposition in NU-1200.",

      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the effect of base on the binding motif of the anchored molybdenum species on the Zr6 node?",
      "answer": "In the presence of base, the pristine Mo1 coordination mode of molybdenum species completely evolves into the pristine Mo2 anchoring mode on the Zr node.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of the base in the alcohol oxidation reaction catalyzed by Mo-NU-1200?",
      "answer": "The base influences the evolution of the structure of the installed molybdenum species on the Zr6 node, affecting the catalytic activity.",

      "type": "reasoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Does the MOF structure retain its crystallinity after the oxidation reaction?",
      "answer": "True, PXRD patterns revealed that the frameworks remained crystalline after the oxidation reaction.",

      "type": "True or False"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the impact of the structural changes in the molybdenum species on the catalytic activity of Mo-NU-1200?",
      "answer": "The structural changes in the binding motifs of molybdenum species result in distinct differences in catalytic activities, with the octahedral geometry and longer terminal Mo–O bond distance showing higher reaction activity.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "reasoning"

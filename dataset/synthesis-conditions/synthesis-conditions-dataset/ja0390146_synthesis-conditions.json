The resulting product contained brown crystals of NTHU-2 with an optimum yield up to ∼70% (based on Zn) and a small quantity of unknown phase. EPMA data confirmed the Zn:P ratio to be 1:1 for the brown crystals and the results of EA confirm the organic content. Found/calcd. (%):  C, 36.86/36.71; N, 4.20/4.08; H, 3.40/3.23."

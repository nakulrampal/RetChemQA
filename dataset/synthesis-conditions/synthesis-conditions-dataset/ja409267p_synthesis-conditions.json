The solid was then separated by centrifugation and dissolved in methanol-d4. The methanol-d4 solution was collected and 5 µmol of mesitylene was added as an internal standard. The NMR spectrum was recorded to quantify the recovered H2L (at a recovery rate of >90%) based on integrations of proton peaks.",

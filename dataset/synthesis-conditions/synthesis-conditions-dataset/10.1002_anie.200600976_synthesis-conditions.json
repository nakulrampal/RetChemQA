        "temperature_control": "low-temperature nitrogen gas blower",
        "additional_information": "Before the measurements, the sample was heated to 390 K for 15 min in vacuum to remove water molecules present in the nanochannels. The diffraction pattern at 390 K was confirmed to be that of the anhydrous hollow phase of CPL-1. After that, acetylene gas was dosed into the capillary sample through a stainless steel tube. The amount of gas adsorption was controlled by changing the sample temperature under constant gas pressure.",

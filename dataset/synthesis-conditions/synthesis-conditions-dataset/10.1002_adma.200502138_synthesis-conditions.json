        "additional_information": "The powder X-ray diffraction spectra were recorded using a Siemens D500 X-ray diffraction instrument with a 0.005 s step size, each of 0.20°. The scanning ranged from 20° to 70°. TGA were performed using a PerkinElmer TGA7 analyzer. The samples were heated at a heating rate of 5 °C min–1 from room temperature to 900 °C under a N2 atmosphere. The luminescence spectra were recorded using a PerkinElmer LS 50B luminescence spectrophotometer that was equipped with an R928 photomultiplier tube with a 5 nm slit width and 0.5 s integration times at 298 K with excitation at 325 nm. The spectra were corrected for detector response and stray background light phosphorescence."

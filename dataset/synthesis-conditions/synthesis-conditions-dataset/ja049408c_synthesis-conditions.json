The system was evacuated overnight and purged three times with ultra high purity grade analyte gas before cooling to 77 K. Gases were passed through a molecular sieve trap before being exposed to the sample. Pressures were measured with MKS Baratron transducers. The adsorbate was added incrementally and data points were recorded when no further change in mass was observed."

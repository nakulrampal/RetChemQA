        "Temperature": "581 K for crystalline covalent-organic framework formation, 873–1073 K for carbonization",
        "Chemicals_Used": "Ni-containing cyclic porphyrin dimer (Ni2-CPDPy)",
        "Time": "Not specified",
        "Yield": "91% at 1073 K",
        "Additional_Information": "The Ni2-CPDPy crystal is thermally converted into a crystalline covalent-organic framework at 581 K and further into ordered carbonaceous frameworks by subsequent carbonization at 873–1073 K."

        "Temperature": "540 K for initial thermal behavior, 1073 K for carbonization",
        "Chemicals_Used": "Free base porphyrin (H4-CPDPy)",
        "Time": "Not specified",
        "Yield": "77% at 1073 K",
        "Additional_Information": "H4-CPDPy does not exhibit weight loss for temperatures ≤750 K, demonstrating heat-stability and minimal volatility. However, it afforded a lower yield compared to Ni2-CPDPy and did not retain an ordered structure upon carbonization."

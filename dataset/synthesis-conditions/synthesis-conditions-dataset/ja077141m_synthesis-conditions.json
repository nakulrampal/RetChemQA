The aqueous solution of the metal perchlorate was placed in a 50 mL beaker, and the n-butanol solution of DPP was carefully layered on top of the water layer. The beaker was covered with Parafilm and then left to stand. After a few days, crystals of the DPP complex formed at the interface of the solvents, and some crystals began to fall to the bottom of the beaker. The solutions were filtered under vacuum and air-dried."

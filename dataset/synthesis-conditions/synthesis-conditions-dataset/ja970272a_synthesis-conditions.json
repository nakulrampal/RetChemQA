If the crystals of the α-phase are not isolated from the mother liquor in approximately 5 days after preparing the solution, the luminescent crystals of the β-phase start precipitating as well, thus contaminating the desired nonluminescent product. The mother liquor left standing for several days either at room temperature or at an elevated temperature (55 °C) produced block-shaped crystals of the β-phase."

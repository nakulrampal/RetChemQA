Octahedral single crystals (exposing the 111 face) and microcrystalline powder were prepared according to the Wu et al. strategy. Single crystals with a size up to 300 μm were grown by increasing the cooling time up to 12 h. The single crystals were washed by decanting three times with 60 °C DMF and stored in Cl3CH."

          "details": "Microcrystalline pellets were activated by heating to 200 °C for 20 h at 10−3 mbar. This treatment retrieves a complete removal of guest molecules. Activated pellets for impedance spectroscopy were loaded into the sample holder by working in a glovebox with N2 atmosphere and ca. 5 ppm of H2O. More gentle activation treatments were tested on single crystals to retain high single-crystal quality."

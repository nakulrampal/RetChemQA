        "additional_information": "In situ hydrolysis of DMF produces formic acid and dimethyl ammonium cation, which are the building blocks for the material. Longer room temperature crystallization over a period of a few months produced perfect cube-shaped transparent crystals. Synthesis conditions have been optimized and the synthesis is reproducible as a pure single phase compound."

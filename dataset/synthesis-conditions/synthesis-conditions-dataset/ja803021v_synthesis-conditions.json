The single crystal double faces were covered with conducting Ag-glue. The applied electric field should increase gradually from small voltages to high voltages to see which voltages can reach the saturation polarization in P-E curve. One sample will take two hours to try to reach the ideal hysteresis loop. Ps=5.7µC/cm2 for MOF 1 without water and Ps=5.8µC/cm2 for MOF 1 with water at fixed frequency 12Hz."

          "description": "Upon addition of dilute HCl to colloidal bismuth subcitrate, a white precipitate formed. The bismuth concentration in the filtrate decreased dramatically from over 70 mg/mL at pH 6.7 to only 1 mg/mL at pH 3. Upon observation under microscope, it was revealed that precipitate 1 that was isolated at pH 3 consisted of tiny crystals. On standing at room temperature for several days, colorless crystals of K(NH4)[Bi2(cit)2(H2O)2]·4H2O, suitable for X-ray analysis, formed in the filtrate (pH ≈ 3).",

          "additional_information": "The synthesis involves a gradual and reversible structural deformation under either thermal or pressure stimulation. The TPPA molecules, coordinately bound to the channel in a face-to-face arrangement, alter their conformation and arrangement in response to these stimuli."

          "results": "Although these solvent-exchanged crystals exhibited a slight change in the fluorescence signal, their stimuli-responsive luminescent character fully remained and was not strongly dependent on the nature of the solvent, including linear dependence on stimuli and reversibility."

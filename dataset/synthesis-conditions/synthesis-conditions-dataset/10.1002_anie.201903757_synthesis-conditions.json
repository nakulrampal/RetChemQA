The PXRD patterns of the 1-PVA membrane matched the combined patterns of PVA and 1. In the IR of 1-PVA, the O@H stretching vibration was shifted to the lower wavenumber at 3250 cm@1 compared with that of pure PVA (3404 cm@1), suggesting the formation of stronger O@H···F bonding interactions between the OH groups of PVA and the F atoms of 3-F-spy ligands in 1."

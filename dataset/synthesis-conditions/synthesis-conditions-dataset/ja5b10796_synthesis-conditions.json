        "method": "arc-discharging",
        "details": "The mixture of graphite powder and Y/Ni alloy with a mass ratio of 1:3 was packed into core-drilled graphite rods. The rods were burnt in a Krätschmer-Huffman generator under an atmosphere of 6 Torr N2 and 194 Torr He. The as-prepared soot was Soxlet-extracted with toluene for 24 h. Y2@C79N was isolated and purified by multi-step high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and the purity of Y2@C79N was determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS)."

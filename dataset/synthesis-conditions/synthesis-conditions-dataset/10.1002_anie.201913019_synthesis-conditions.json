  "general_notes": "The synthesis involves the reaction of a novel NIT radical derivative with a terbium(III) building block, leading to the formation of chiral supramolecular nanotubes. The reaction solvent heptane plays a key role in the thermodynamic stabilization of these nanotubes. The compound is stable up to a melting temperature of 120 88C. Upon removal from the mother solution, the crystals quickly lose their crystallinity but not their crystal shape, as observed in SEM images."

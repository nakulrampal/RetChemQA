Different wafers with the diameter of 3 mm diameter and different thickness from 0.6 mm to 0.8 mm were prepared. The Au electrode was deposited on two sides of wafer by thermal evaporation. The device with symmetric structure Au/SCU-12/Au was further embedded in a cathode irradiation configuration, as shown in the inset of Figure 1c in main text."

For a typical experiment, current-time curve (I-t curve) was recorded under constant X-ray irradiation at received dosage with 16 Gy and 36 Gy, respectively. The structural stability of SCU-12 under gamma rays is performed under the Co-60 gamma source with the dose of 30 and 60 kGy, respectively."

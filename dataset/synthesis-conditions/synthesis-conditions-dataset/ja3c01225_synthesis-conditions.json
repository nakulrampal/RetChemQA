The capillary was fixed on the tip of an optical fiber and irradiated by UV light using a Ushio OpticalModulex high-pressure Hg lamp (12 A) with a 385 nm long wavelength cut filter. The temperature of the photoreaction was controlled by performing photoirradiation while immersing the capillary in liquid baths. After irradiation, the capillary was crushed, and the sample was dissolved in DMSO-d6 and DCl for 1H NMR spectra measurements."

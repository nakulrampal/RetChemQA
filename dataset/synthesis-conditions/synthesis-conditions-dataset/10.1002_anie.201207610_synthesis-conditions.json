        "additional_information": "The crystal structure of 1 is shown in Figure 1. Each Eu center adopts a bicapped trigonal-prismatic geometry with six oxygen donors from carboxylate groups and two from coordinated water molecules occupying the eight coordination sites. Adjacent pairs of Eu centers are quadruply bridged by carboxylates to form one-dimensional (1D) chains along the a-axis. Each 1D chain is linked to four adjacent chains through L ligands, extending the structure into a 3D framework with solvent channels along the a-axis, where DMF molecules are located."

        "additional_information": "The difference between 2 and 3 is that 2 is air dried while 3 is dried under vacuum which is necessary before it can be transferred into the glovebox. Keeping in mind the two water molecules per Eu center in the crystal structure of 2, the 0.5 coordinated water molecules per Eu found in 3-H2O/D2O sample is likely the direct consequence of the drying process."

          "Single Crystal X-ray Diffraction": "Single crystals were mounted on a BRUKER APEX2 V2.1-0 diffractometer equipped with a graphite-monochromated MoKa ((cid:2) = 0.71073 Å) radiation source in a cold nitrogen stream. All crystallographic data were corrected for Lorentz and polarization effects (SAINT). The structures were solved by direct methods and refined by the full-matrix least-squares method on F2 with appropriate software implemented in the SHELXTL program package. All the non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. Hydrogen atoms were added at their geometrically ideal positions. Most of the DMF solvent molecules are severely disordered, which hindered satisfactory development of the model; therefore, the SQUEEZE routine (PLATON) was applied to remove the contributions of electron density from disordered solvent molecules. The outputs from the SQUEEZE calculations are attached to the CIF file.",

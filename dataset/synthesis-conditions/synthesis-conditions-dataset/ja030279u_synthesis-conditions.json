          "A well shaped single crystal of dimensions 0.3 × 0.3 × 0.2 mm3 was selected and mounted for X-ray diffraction data collection.",
          "The sample was cooled to 114 K to decrease thermal smearing effects.",
          "X-ray diffraction data were collected using ω-scans at different θ detector positions (2θ = 0°, 20°, 22.4°, and 24.3°) to allow high redundancy and high-resolution data measurements.",
          "Oscillation width (2°) and exposure time (180 s) were selected and kept constant throughout the experiment.",
          "48,889 reflections were integrated on 894 frames up to a resolution of 0.98 Å-1 with the DENZO program implemented in the HKL2000 package.",
          "Final cell parameters were deduced from a least-squares postrefinement on all measured reflections.",
          "Interframe scaling using the intensity of equivalent reflections was checked and did not show any crystal decay during data collection; this scaling procedure was nevertheless applied.",
          "The crystal faces were indexed and accurately measured to correct from absorption effects by Gaussian integration (ABSORB).",
          "Diffracted intensities were reduced and merged in the mmm Laue group, using program SORTAV, yielding 4567 unique reflections of which 3301 have I > 3σ(I)."

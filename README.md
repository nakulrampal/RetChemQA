## License 

The dataset is distributed under the MIT open source license (see [`LICENSE.txt`](LICENSE.txt))

## Contributing

If you have any questions/comments/feedback, please feel free to reach out to any of the authors.

In addition, if you have any new feature requests or if you find any bugs, please open a new [issue](https://github.com/nakulrampal/RetChemQA/issues).

Some issues we have encountered include (i) questions being generated from unrelated sections of a PDF, and (ii) incomplete processing of PDFs, which results in Q&A pairs being generated from only a small portion of the text.
